the university, in addition to outreach and encouragement from Senator Mark Warner. Policy makers from across the country, including at the federal level have sought a centralized hub for information and data about testing as they evaluate plans to re-open economies and craft policy responses to counter the spread of the disease. The new Testing Insights Initiative will provide such a resource and help guide leaders as they consider how and when to re-open.\\n\\nThe COVID-19 Testing Insights Initiative reflects an interdisciplinary collaboration between several groups at Johns Hopkins University: The Bloomberg School of Public Health, Applied Physics Laboratory, Center for Health Security, Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) in the Whiting School of Engineering, and the Centers for Civic Impact, which is supported in part by Bloomberg Philanthropies.  Data and technical support is provided by the Atlantic\u2019s COVID Tracking Project, ESRI and the JHU Sheridan Libraries. "},{"slug":"how-is-covid-19-diagnosed","question":"How is COVID-19 diagnosed?","answer":"In the United States, diagnostic testing for COVID-19 involves testing for the presence of the virus in specimens obtained from patients. Almost all diagnostic testing for COVID-19 is done using PCR-based methods, which look for the genetic material of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19. These methods can only diagnose someone with COVID-19 if they are actively infected. Currently, most diagnostic tests for COVID-19 test nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal specimens (nose or throat swabs). Recently, the FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization to a laboratory to test patients\u2019 saliva."},{"slug":"what-are-limitations-to-covid-19-diagnostic-tests","question":"What are limitations to COVID-19 diagnostic tests?","answer":"With any diagnostic test, there is the potential for false negatives or false positives. For existing COVID-19 tests in the U.S., there have been reports of false negative tests in some patients. False negative tests can occur if a specimen was not properly obtained or if a patient was tested too early or too late in their infection. Laboratory error is also a possible cause of false negative test results. Conversely, false positive reports are less common."},{"slug":"who-should-be-tested-for-covid-19","question":"Who should be tested for COVID-19?","answer":"Individuals who have symptoms of COVID-19 should be tested for the SARS-CoV-2 virus so that they will know to isolate themselves from others so as not to spread the disease. In certain cases, such as outbreak investigation, testing of people without symptoms is also indicated. However, current limitations in testing capacity have restricted who may be tested for COVID-19. Recommendations regarding who should and can be tested differ by state. Some states that have experienced large numbers of COVID-19 cases have requested that individuals who are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 assume that they are positive and avoid health facilities unless they experience severe symptoms."},{"slug":"what-are-serology-tests-and-how-are-they-used","question":"What are serology tests and how are they used?","answer":"Serology tests are blood-based tests that can be used to identify whether people have been exposed to a particular pathogen by looking at their antibodies, or specific proteins produced by the body in response to an infection. Serology tests can be helpful in determining whether someone was infected in the past with the coronavirus, whether or not they ever developed symptoms of the disease.\\n\\nIn contrast, the PCR tests currently being used to diagnose active cases of COVID-19 can only indicate the presence of viral genetic material during the period of active infection and do not indicate if a person was infected and subsequently recovered. "},{"slug":"what-are-some-limitations-of-serology-tests","question":"What are some limitations of serology tests?","answer":"Unlike PCR-based tests that test for presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, serology tests cannot be used to diagnose whether someone currently has the COVID-19 disease. Also, antibody levels have not been correlated with immunity; while people who have been infected are presumed to have some immunity, it is unclear how much and for how long. Though labs that perform or companies selling tests to diagnose COVID-19 must receive Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the FDA, the FDA has granted regulatory discretion to companies that develop and market serology tests and does not require them to apply for an EUA. As a result, there has not been a formal evaluation of the performance of serology tests that are currently available. Some reports have raised concerns about the validity of serology tests currently being used. The NIH, FDA, CDC, and academic investigators are in the process of validating serology tests."},{"slug":"how-long-does-it-take-to-get-test-results","question":"How long does it take to get test results?","answer":"Timely test results are important to inform clinical care and to support public health measures to control COVID-19. The sooner patients receive test results, the sooner infected individuals can be isolated, before they transmit their infection to others. And, the contacts of infected individuals can be traced and monitored so that they, too, can take preventive measures to avoid spreading the disease.\\n\\nCurrently, the time it takes to get testing results in the U.S. can vary based on several factors. Different testing technologies produce results in different time frames. For example, some testing machines promise results in <30 minutes, whereas some laboratory methods can take hours. If a health facility has to send a test out to a separate laboratory, it can take additional time due to transit \u2013 a day or more depending on how far the facility is from the laboratory. It may also take additional time to relay the test result to the healthcare provider and patient. Across the U.S., delays in testing due to shortages of testing supplies have been reported."},{"slug":"do-patients-have-to-pay-to-get-tested","question":"Do patients have to pay to get tested?","answer":"In March 2020, the U.S. Congress passed and the President signed into law the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which requires governmental and private insurance plans to cover the cost of COVID-19 testing. The law does not protect against out-of-network charges or charges for visits for possible coronavirus infection that do not result in testing. While Congress set aside funds to test the uninsured, it is possible that some people without insurance will nonetheless be billed. The law does not cover the cost of COVID-19 treatment."},{"slug":"where-do-people-go-to get-tested","question":"Where do people go to get tested?","answer":"Testing sites vary by state and locality. In some places, testing is only offered at health facilities and may be reserved for hospitalized patients. Some states have established community testing sites, such as drive-through testing clinics."},{"slug":"why-are-there-inconsistencies-among-testing-data-for-covid-19","question":"Why are there inconsistencies among testing data for COVID-19?","answer":"The website relies upon publicly available data from multiple sources that are not always consistent in how and when they are released and updated. States may report components of testing data with different cadences, or they may even change how they report categories of data over time, all of which can affect calculations of the rate of positivity. For example, some states report testing positives separately from testing negatives, which may make it appear that 100% of their tests were positive or 100% negative on that day. Also, states have changed how they count positives and negative test results and may retroactively change the numbers reported.\\n\\nIt is important to track the testing that states are doing to diagnose people with COVID-19 infection in order to gauge the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. and to know whether enough testing is occurring. When states report the number of COVID-19 tests performed, this should include the number of viral tests performed and the number of patients for which these tests were performed. Currently, states may not be distinguishing overall tests administered from the number of individuals who have been tested. This is an important limitation to the data that is available to track testing in the U.S., and states should work to address it.\\n\\nWhen states report testing numbers for COVID-19 infection, they should not include serology or antibody tests. Antibody tests are not used to diagnose active COVID-19 infection and they do not provide insights into the number of cases of COVID-19 diagnosed or whether viral testing is sufficient to find infections that are occurring within each state. States that include serology tests within their overall COVID-19 testing numbers are misrepresenting their testing capacity and the extent to which they are working to identify COVID-19 infections within their communities. States that wish to track the number of serology tests being performed should report those numbers separately from viral tests performed to diagnose COVID-19."}]},{"slug":"facts-viral-and-serology-tests","title":"Facts: Viral and Serology Tests"}]')},function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('[{"slug":"overview","title":"Overview","questions":[{"slug":"what-is-the-pandemic-data-initiative","question":"What is the Pandemic Data Initiative?","answer":"We started the Pandemic Data Initiative because we realized there was a lack of a voice around what COVID-19 data is depicting and how the data exists as a resource for lay people, academics, the media, and policy makers.\\n\\nThere is a lot of complexity in the way COVID-19 data has been collected and reported that we haven\u2019t been able to fully contextualize because of a lack of uniformity in how state and federal agencies manage it.

And that leads to more complications for dealing with the last mile of vaccination outreach to hard-to-reach communities and to those who are hesitant to get vaccinated. As vaccine supply is outpacing demand it is critically important that we know who to reach out to, who is seeking out vaccines and who is not, and how best to target public education in communities with high levels of vaccine hesitancy.\\n\\nWe don\u2019t even know who is still trying to find a vaccine and who is still having difficulty. There are people who may not have a computer or broadband access but who still very much want to get vaccinated, but if governments do not know where they are they can\u2019t connect them with sign-up services that are entirely online.\\n\\nIf cities had access to data showing exactly who wanted vaccines but couldn\u2019t access them they would be able to deploy mobile units to try to reach those communities. Instead they are stuck using anecdotal information on how to deploy those resources rather than being super targeted. \\n\\nEven at federally funded FEMA mass vaccination sites it\u2019s unclear whether the data of who\u2019s getting vaccinated is being provided to local government.

This is not a problem that is going to disappear. It\u2019s only going to get worse as we continue to confront significant public health challenges.\\n\\nThe federal government needs to more aggressively promote their ability to help state and local governments. The federal government has some of the smartest data thinkers in places like the Census Bureau, the CDC, and the U.S. Digital Service. There are plenty of people throughout the federal government who know how to do this.  \\n\\nOne thing I\u2019ve learned over the last year is that government wants to be better at this. We\u2019ve had governors and mayors calling the Centers for Civic Impact telling us they want to improve their data and they want help to get their data efforts into shape.\\n\\nIt\u2019s not for a lack of wanting to do a better job. It\u2019s really for a lack of the capacity to understand how to do a better job. And a lot of that was driven by the fact that there were no standards so cities and states were making gut calls on how to do it. Some of them got it right, some of them didn\u2019t.

Dowdy, *Associate Professor, Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health*\\n\\nNicholas W. Papageorge, *Broadus Mitchell Associate Professor of Economics, Johns Hopkins Krieger School of Arts and Sciences*","content":"The U.S. is now in the midst of a public health crisis, a Main Street jobs implosion, and a surge in companies on \u2018risk of bankruptcy\u2019 lists. Extreme social distancing, the single best hope for stemming the viral pandemic, is painfully also the driving force generating the sharp contraction of economic activity and, in turn, the slide for financial markets. This has elicited a facile storyline. Epidemiologists and economists, charged with attending to different goals, are now compelled to do mortal combat. We think this is flat out wrong.   \\u2028\\u2028Any hope of constructing an intelligent plan for the U.S. populace in the months ahead will require thoughtful collaboration, not conflict, between public health and economics professionals. Just as an unchecked pandemic would be disastrous for the economy, a sharp economic downturn would be catastrophic for the public\u2019s health. The goals of epidemiologists and economists are therefore fundamentally aligned.\\n\\nAt the moment, both groups are desperate for precisely the same data. Namely, how much of the U.S. population has already been infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and by extension, what fraction of infections lead to serious illness, hospitalization, and death? Answering these questions will not only inform an appropriate public health and economic response, but it will also facilitate the sort of thoughtful discussion public health and economic experts must urgently have, if we are to chart a rational course out of the current crisis. We must institute a representative survey of U.S. individuals and households, to understand the scope of the infection already in place. Only with these data can we understand how often COVID-19 infection leads to more serious consequences.  \\n\\nWe must also conduct well-designed surveys to measure how strictly social distancing is followed, under which social and economic circumstances it is not, and how such measures, enacted to different degrees in different populations, affect the spread of the illness. With this information in hand, epidemiological models of disease transmission can be combined with economic models of behavior under risk and uncertainty to make more realistic predictions of the future of the pandemic and of the economy. The two disciplines, working together and combining expertise, can then work together to hammer out an intelligent strategy for navigating the current crisis and preparing for the next pandemic (which will inevitably occur).\\n\\nA reliable estimate of the fraction of the population that has been infected with COVID-19 (and thus likely to be immune), at a national, state, and local level, is the lodestone of data that will inform possible strategies for more targeted distancing, quarantining, and isolation-imposing strategies. Simultaneously, economists, in possession of a sense of COVID-19\u2019s progression overall, and in communities, can think about more targeted mitigation approaches. Central to any such efforts must be high-quality data on the uneven burden and practice of protective measures, such as social distancing, depending on people\u2019s economic circumstances and other household characteristics. \\n\\n\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. has been breathtaking\u2014with deaths in the U.S. doubling every three days in the last month. As the state and local leaders and the general public came to understand the nature of exponential growth, broad recommendations for social distancing were put in place. Similarly, as it became clear that these necessary distancing measures were derailing economic activity, the U.S. Federal Reserve, the Congress, and the White House combined to deliver unprecedented blanket economic support.\\n\\nWhat we will soon hear, if we are lucky, is news that social distancing is flattening the curve\u2014the first hint, most recently, is a lengthening in the doubling time for deaths from 2.5 to 3.5 days. If this early evidence of curve flattening is sustained, we will urgently need to craft both a new set of public health policies and a new set of economic and financial market supports. To repeat for emphasis, effectively delivering on these tasks requires that we broadly test and survey the U.S. population to understand both the level of infection and the effects of individual behavior in reducing infection rates. The fruits of that survey effort will be central to informing strategies that are tailored to the crisis at hand, protecting the health of those most vulnerable to the illness and the well-being of those most vulnerable to economic downturns.\\n\xa0\\nIn short, epidemiologists and economists, jointly pursuing the well-being of the U.S. populace, must rapidly learn to join hands in providing appropriate guidance to our nation\u2019s leaders as to how to weather the current pandemic. What they both desperately need is data that can help them sort out the next rounds of policy in this terribly difficult time.   \\u2028\\n","legacyIsNew":null,"isDrafted":null,"order":null,"date":"","attachments":[],"verticals":[],"authors":[]},{"id":6,"slug":"do-social-networks-increase-or-decrease-the-covid-19-contagion-rate","meta":{"path":"/from-our-experts/do-social-networks-increase-or-decrease-the-covid-19-contagion-rate","title":"Do Social Networks Increase or Decrease the COVID-19 Contagion Rate?","description":"Matt Kahn, Bloomberg Distinguished Professor of Economics and Business and Director of the 21st Century Cities Initiative at Johns Hopkins University, and Dora L.

But some people are choosing to continue to live their lives under business as usual.   Behavioral economics assumes that many of us, like the college students who stormed the beaches of Florida for spring break, focus on the here and now and thus lack the willpower to self isolate at this critical juncture.  \\n\\nThe desire to socialize pushes us to meet and interact face to face,  but social capital, the bonds between us, can push us to self isolate. Social sanctions and the fear of ostracism can play a role in encouraging pro-social behavior at a time when only a few nations [such as Italy](https://www.kusi.com/i/the-latest-italy-raises-fines-for-lock-down-violators/) (which is fining people for up to $3,300) and [India](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/world/asia/india-lockdown-coronavirus.html) (which is using [corporal punishment](https://nypost.com/2020/03/25/police-in-india-use-force-on-coronavirus-lockdown-violators/) in some cases) are using the formal power of the state to enforce social isolation.  Social capital can decrease contagion risk because it helps solve the classic free rider problem of who is willing to engage in costly sacrifice for the common good.   The free rider problem arises when socially beneficial actions impose costs on individuals and each person hopes that every other person will comply with the social norm. Our research documents that this problem is exacerbated when people live in more unequal communities as measured by income inequality and age and ethnic diversity.\\n\\nAround the world, each nation is wrestling with how to utilize both the formal rule of law and social sanction to achieve the overall social goal of greater isolation compliance.   In the biggest coronavirus success story thus far, [Taiwan](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2020/03/19/taiwan-shows-its-mettle-in-coronavirus-crisis-while-the-who-is-mia/), mandatory quarantines are enforced by the neighborhood warden system, tracking of cell phones with follow-ups by police officers if phones are shut off, and periodic administrative checks on those in quarantine.  In China, neighborhood committees enforced quarantines by taking temperatures and checking the travel permits of anyone entering a neighborhood.   India has resorted to physical punishments such as canings for those found out and about.  Italy introduced a formal deterrence system of fines and is using drones to look for quarantine violators after cell phone data showed informal deterrence failed.  Israel\u2019s Supreme Court approved tracking the cell phones of citizens with coronavirus after placing an injunction on the practice.  [South Korea](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/coronavirus-cases-have-dropped-sharply-south-korea-whats-secret-its-success) has dramatically slowed its cases with testing, contact tracing, and individual quarantines but without lockdowns or authoritarian measures.  Sweden is relying on individuals\u2019 personal responsibility and sacrifice to self-quarantine.  Sweden\u2019s Prime Minister  [Stefan L\xf6fven](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/24/sweden-coronavirus-open-for-business/) said; \u201cThe only way to manage this crisis is to face it as a society, with everyone taking responsibility for themselves, for each other and for our country.\u201d The United States is relying on self-quarantines as well. \\n\\nAn alternative to force is to rely on nudges and social sanction to encourage compliance.  Authority figures such as [University Presidents are nudging people](https://www.baltimoresun.com/opinion/op-ed/bs-ed-op-0325-coronavirus-hopkins-social-distancing-20200324-b75k465kdfcq3jt235mr7uzaba-story.html) to isolate.  The effectiveness of such appeals hinges on who is an \u201cinfluential\u201d in guiding the choices of others. For some it will be celebrities while for others it will be our leaders. \\n\\nWithout formal criminal or financial penalties for noncompliance, each nation is asking its citizens to sacrifice for the greater good. An interdisciplinary research agenda featuring contributions by political scientists, economists and sociologists has studied this issue by examining civic activities such as volunteering, filling out census forms or giving blood.  \\n\\nOur own research has documented [that income inequality](https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/kyklos/v56y2003i1p17-46.html) in the city where one lives is an important determinant of free riding and not being civically engaged.  National rankings of social capital suggest [that the U.S is ranked relatively low](http://solability.com/the-global-sustainable-competitiveness-index/the-index/social-capital).  Nations and communities featuring less social capital are more likely to face a greater free rider challenge such that fewer people comply with the social isolation goal and thus the disease contagion accelerates.\\n\\nWe have also studied distinctive measures of being civically engaged in high stakes settings in our [work on the U.S Civil War](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691137049/heroes-and-cowards). We have examined the records of more than 40,000 men who fought in the US Civil War.  One of our indicators of civic engagement was not deserting from one\u2019s unit.  Desertion increased one\u2019s own survival probability but it put the other men in the unit at risk. We document that soldiers are less likely to desert, and thus to sacrifice for the greater good, when the men in their unit were of the same ethnicity, occupation and age. The \u201cband of brothers\u201d mentality encouraged civic engagement.   This camaraderie built up in these war communities helped men survive extreme conditions such as those in the notorious POW camp of Andersonville.  Those imprisoned with their buddies could help each other and were more likely to survive.\\n\\nSocial isolation imposes higher costs on different people.  Richer, more educated people have an easier time engaging in self isolation because their jobs can be completed at home and these people live in nicer, roomier spaces.  Those who find Facebook and Skype to be a close substitute for face to face interaction, will face a lower cost of physical isolation.   More social people will suffer more from social distancing but since these people have more friends who in turn are likely to have more friends, it is exactly for this group that we need to encourage them to sacrifice in the short run.\\n\\nNobody intends to accelerate contagion risk.  Within tight social networks such as families, loved ones know who is the most likely to break the social rules.  Norm enforces within such family networks have an incentive to anticipate these tendencies and to take actions to discourage such socially costly risk taking.  Social pressure through the actions of families, neighbors and communities and celebrities influence our behavior and help to achieve aggregate risk reduction.","legacyIsNew":null,"isDrafted":null,"order":null,"date":"","attachments":[],"verticals":[],"authors":[]},{"id":3,"slug":"protecting-your-health","meta":{"path":"/covid-19-basics/protecting-your-health","title":"Protecting Your Health","description":"Johns Hopkins experts offer best practices for protecting your health, the health of others, and preventing the spread of coronavirus.","image":""},"section":"COVID-19 Basics","title":"Protecting Your Health","subtitle":null,"caption":"Johns Hopkins experts offer best practices for protecting your health, the health of others, and preventing the spread of coronavirus.","content":"[What Do I Do If I Feel Sick?](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/coronavirus-what-if-i-feel-sick)\\n[Younger Adults Are at Risk, Too](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/coronavirus-and-covid-19-younger-adults-are-at-risk-too)\\n[Coronavirus at a Glance: Infographic](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/coronavirus-facts-infographic)\\n[Coronavirus Test: What You Need to Know](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/coronavirus-test-what-you-need-to-know)\\n[I\u2019ve Been Diagnosed With COVID-19, What Should I Expect?](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/diagnosed-with-covid-19-what-to-expect)\\n[How Can I Protect Myself and Others From COVID-19?](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/how-can-i-protect-myself-from-coronavirus)\\n[Coronavirus, Social Distancing, and Self-Quarantine](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/coronavirus-social-distancing-and-self-quarantine)\\n[Practicing Wellness While You Stay at Home](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/coronavirus-practicing-wellness-while-you-stay-at-home)\\n[Coronavirus in Babies and Children](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/coronavirus-in-babies-and-children)\\n[Caregiving for the Elderly](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/coronavirus-caregiving-for-the-elderly)\\n[What To Do If Your Kids Stay Home](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/coronavirus-what-to-do-if-your-kids-stay-home)","legacyIsNew":null,"isDrafted":null,"order":null,"date":"","attachments":[],"verticals":[],"authors":[]},{"id":4,"slug":"the-unequal-cost-of-social-distancing","meta":{"path":"/from-our-experts/the-unequal-cost-of-social-distancing","title":"The Unequal Cost of Social Distancing","description":"Social distancing will save lives, but the economic fallout of social distancing is brutal for the poorest, most vulnerable and marginalized members of ...","image":""},"section":"From Our Experts","title":"The Unequal Cost of Social Distancing","subtitle":null,"caption":"Stefanie DeLuca, *James Coleman Professor of Sociology & Social Policy*  \\nNick Papageorge, *Broadus Mitchell Associate Professor of Economics*  \\nEmma Kalish, *PhD student in Economics*","content":"Social distancing will save lives.(i)  Its economic costs are staggering. While frustrating but manageable for many people(ii), the economic fallout of social distancing is brutal for the poorest, most vulnerable and marginalized members of our society. Even looking at the issue purely in terms of lives lost, injuries sustained, and lifelong psychological damage, there are tradeoffs that we feel have not been sufficiently acknowledged. \\n\\nUnemployment will lead to increases in suicide, substance abuse, domestic violence, homelessness and food insecurity. Substance abuse itself\u2014especially the opioid crisis\u2014has already significantly reduced life expectancy in the U.S., and that has been during a time of relative prosperity. Under the current circumstances, it is entirely possible we will see such an impact again. Domestic violence is also deadly, more so now with abusers finding themselves frustrated and at home far more than normal.  \\n\\nThousands of people will die from these causes, and many more will be severely injured and traumatized for life. While these issues can be universal, they fall hardest on the poorest, most vulnerable members of our population, who we know have been the first to lose their jobs and suffer the most from these terrible problems.\\n\\n**Thus, a grim tradeoff is already being made between saving different lives: saving the lives of those who are most vulnerable to COVID-19 versus saving the lives of those who are most vulnerable to suicide, substance abuse, and domestic violence. Moreover, these vulnerabilities mean social distancing may be unsustainable for large swaths of the poorest Americans. As decision makers contemplate medium-term economic versus public health trade-offs, they must do so with an acknowledgement of the severely skewed nature of the costs of distancing.**   \\n \\n#### Why Social Distancing Is So Costly to Vulnerable Households\\n\\nIt is well-documented that economic downturns not only cause human suffering due to scarcity, but also lead to health problems and increases in mortality. **In short, the virus is lethal; but so is poverty.**\\n\\nIn the current climate, this burden is not equally shared. To get a sense of the problem, consider that many low-income workers live hand-to-mouth and are housing and food-insecure even when the economy is roaring. **Even before COVID-19 hit, only 61 percent of all American families had $400 of emergency savings.** Many low-income workers are not salaried, but work hourly or are part of the \u201cgig\u201d economy. They are more likely to work in retail and service occupations, such as restaurants and salons, and cannot set up home offices to work remotely. In the short-run, closure of businesses, lack of work for hourly or \u201cgig\u201d workers, and layoffs quickly deplete resources of low-income families, making it impossible to meet their most basic of needs. Due to school closures, even more workers are also forced to choose between taking care of their children and working (a tradeoff already faced by so many working poor parents due to the high costs of child care). Without reliable internet, printers and tech-savvy parents, children in low income families are unable to participate in online schooling to the same extent as their more advantaged peers. \\n \\n**The closer we look into the lives of what Michael Harrington famously called \u201cthe other America,\u201d the magnitude of challenges low income families face rises exponentially.** For many, the #StayHome directive is not an option: \u2018home\u2019 is not a safe, comfortable place to be. For example, in Baltimore\u2014like many other cities\u2014many poor families live in cramped, low-quality, uncomfortable and even dangerous dwellings, making it more difficult to shelter in place. Some of this housing also aggravates the asthma symptoms of their children, as mold and vermin infestation trigger episodes. Multigenerational and complex households are also much more common among the poor: in Italy this proved to be a calamitous challenge. People cannot enact self-quarantine protocols in crowded or dangerous settings, which creates more ideal conditions for transmission than might otherwise exist. \\n\\nIn many poor households, at least one member has either been a victim of abuse, has a history of violent behavior or suffers from addiction. **Outbreaks of violence or addictive behaviors occur in times of distress.** Indeed, there are already reports of spikes in child abuse and domestic violence, which means families stuck at home already face immediate physical danger. Abuse and violence also have long-run downstream effects on health, education, and productivity. Moreover, the very institutions designed to protect victims of abuse and violence\u2014courts, social service agencies, and law enforcement\u2014are themselves shutting down or cutting back while they struggle to determine how to implement social distancing. There\u2019s a serious risk that they will operate at significantly reduced capacity at a time when the need for their services is greater than ever. \\n\\nFor many low-income parents and children, leaving the house to go to work or attend school provides a safe haven that can ease tensions in overcrowded homes. Recreation centers, libraries and other community providers often make up the difference between what young people need and what their families provide. Many families also rely on service providers to help with treatment addiction and mental health. As these resources close or cut back service, more needs remain unmet. Beyond these short-term needs, there are added long-term costs to the disruptions in life caused by COVID-19. Low-income students already have unstable trajectories through post-secondary institutions when they are open, something only made worse by the shift to virtual learning. Gaps in their progress, the need to care for family, and other needs can derail their educational careers, again with grave consequences for their future\u2014and for the economy as a whole. The consequences of social distancing for vulnerable people will be wide ranging, and the full impact will likely never be quantified. \\n\\n#### What Can We Realistically Expect People to Do?\\n\\n**Given the uneven burden, a concern is that long-term quarantine or social distancing measures are unsustainable, in part because the costs borne by disadvantaged segments of the population are too brutal.** However, it is also clear that the consequences of business-as-usual are intolerable. Thus, two untenable views emerge. President Trump argues for a potentially disastrous premature curtailment of social distancing. Many public health experts take a more nuanced view that advocates for some longer period of social distancing. When social and economic costs are acknowledged, however, these concerns are usually a footnote, not a priority. Whether or not we agree with this type of \u201ccost-benefit\u201d analysis of social distancing is likely to be beside the point. Shuttering the economy indefinitely is unsustainable because the people bearing the biggest costs are unlikely to or unable to abide by the rules of social distancing. \\n\\nHere, we can learn from previous research on behavior during epidemics. Risky sexual behavior continued through the AIDS epidemic. We don\u2019t need to look exclusively at epidemics to see this; people continue to smoke when they know about its risks. More generally, people make choices that they know have negative future consequences, especially when the alternatives are worse. As social scientists, we spend a lot of time trying to understand why and under what circumstances people take risks or avoid them. However, the time to debate why is not now. **Right now, we must recognize that we cannot expect the most marginalized among us to bear the greatest costs of social distancing for weeks or months on end. If we devise policy based on the assumption that families who cannot put food on the table will stay home indefinitely, we are fooling ourselves.**  \\n\\n#### Going Forward: Research and Policy\\n\\nThere is broad support for policies aimed at mitigating the economic fallout of COVID-19. Last week, the federal government passed a massive stimulus bill with broad bipartisan support. The bill included provisions to help low-income families, such as direct payments to individuals and expanded unemployment insurance. This bill at best buys struggling families, and thus the country, some time. The hope is that we use the time wisely since it does not buy us an indefinite amount of time to shut down the economy. At some point we need to resume normal activity. \\n\\nWhile more help from the federal government is certainly necessary, state and local governments need to step up as well. Many states are taking actions to increase the capacity of their health systems; they must also work to expand services for vulnerable populations. Nine states have re-opened health insurance exchanges, and many school districts are providing free meals for children and families. These are steps in the right direction.\\n\\nWith each passing day, there are aggregate economic effects that become difficult to bounce back from. Moreover, with each passing day, the burdens placed on families rise. As this pandemic goes on, the likelihood of the people who suffer the highest costs of social distancing remaining compliant with public health guidance will go down. This is not sustainable, nor is it an acceptable sacrifice to expect people to make. \\n\\nWe must immediately start testing systematically sampled subsets of the population to understand basic information like infection and mortality rates. Right now, efforts to stem the global COVID-19 pandemic are stymied because this information is either nonexistent or difficult to interpret due to lack of systematic randomized testing. Eventually, when COVID-19 is better understood, such information may lead to targeted interventions with lower economic costs. Instead, we are forced to institute radical, blanket measures to stem the spread of the virus, imposing staggering costs on those least able to incur them. \\n\\nIn addition to the urgent need for policy responses, research must be done so that this disorganized, lethal response does not happen again. Beyond learning how to prepare for the direct health consequences of a pandemic, we must learn more about social costs and human behavior, including how willing and able different groups of people are to social distance. It is important to understand how people at low risk of harm from COVID-19, but high risk of harm from social distancing, weigh these tradeoffs in this uncertain situation. We must also examine the relative effectiveness of our social safety net during this time: which policies were the most protective and which were inefficient? Many of our traditional anti-poverty programs won\u2019t help under social distancing. For example, EBT benefits are useless if people with resources are buying in bulk, therefore hoarding the food low-income parents need. Providing housing vouchers is less likely to relieve housing burdens when landlords can\u2019t meet inspectors or prospective tenants to begin the leasing process. Some special education services cannot be delivered outside of the classroom and in homes without technology. We need to understand far more about the intermediaries who were crucial to the efforts that did mitigate costs, such as the social workers and teachers who creatively risked their own health to deliver therapy and services in the homes of our poorest families. \\n\\nThere are enormous opportunities now, not to mention a duty, to do better not only next time a disaster hits, but all the time, and especially in the wake of this crisis, which will require significant repair. We now have an extraordinary opportunity to learn lessons that will help us craft better policy moving forward.\\n\\n*i.

Barbera, Floyd Norris and Jonathan H. Wright","content":"The global COVID-19 outbreak now sports exponential growth rates for cases and deaths on every continent save Antarctica. Students of the economy must add that we are also in the midst of an unprecedented blow to global output, income, and employment. In financial markets, the pace of decline for equity and corporate bond prices exceeds any on record.\\n\\nWhat we confront is a public health crisis that has elicited necessarily radical action, in the form of extreme social distancing. Perversely, for at least the next several months, the better we do at shutting down human-to-human contact, the more dramatic will be the slide for sales, employment and company cash flows. Absent enormous proactive policy actions, a Main Street/Wall Street deadly dance will put the U.S. and the global economy into deep contraction, irrespective of the resolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. Sensibly, the Federal Reserve, the Congress, and the White House in concert are delivering essential relief. The near-term swoon is inescapable; enacted policies hold out the hope that the plunging activity will not feed on itself.\\n\\nDo the economic costs of ongoing social distancing outweigh the benefits of fewer deaths? They do not.\\n\\nSeveral months from now, the economy/epidemiology tradeoffs will be the issue of the day. In current circumstances, in contrast, there is no tradeoff. Deaths from COVID-19, over the past week, have risen at a 32% per day rate. If deaths climb at only half that trajectory into early May, the total number of American deaths would approach 300,000.\\n\\nIndependent of government dictate, widespread panic \u2013 directly a function of the reality of soaring deaths \u2013 would impose a bottom up shutdown of economic activity. Thus, at least for the next several months, the economic and epidemiological calculus comes to the same conclusion. We need to impose radical social distancing, to stem the surge of COVID-19 infection.\\n\\n#### Not a Forecast, a Nowcast\\n\\nTo repeat, the collapse for economic activity, a direct result of social distancing, is not a prediction. It is already well underway. When workers lose their jobs, they file for unemployment benefits. In deep recessions, weekly filings climb to peaks around 700,000. Last week, as the improbable chart below depicts, weekly filings eclipsed 3 million. Nothing even remotely close to that has been recorded since data collection began in 1967.\\n\\nAn explosive rise for joblessness is baked into the cake, given the collapse for activity in the transportation, accommodation and food services industries. Those sectors alone account for 6 percent of GDP and 12 percent of employment. Simply extend this level of filings for a few more weeks and the U.S. unemployment rate will go from 3.5% \u2013 the lowest recorded rate in 50 years \u2013 to a rate in the teens, something not seen since the 1930s Great Depression. Nothing can rescue current economic activity, which is contracting at a double-digit annualized rate. The $2 trillion stimulus package, which was passed by the U.S. Senate earlier this week and is headed back to the House for a final vote, is meant to stem this tsunami.\\n\\n![Initial Jobless Claims](/images/articles/image1.jpg \\"Initial Jobless Claims\\")\\n\\n#### Corporations and Crises\\n\\nWe spoke, above, of likely damaged economic machinery thwarting economic recovery. That machinery is largely found on Wall Street. Companies collect dollars, spend dollars, service debt, and keep the rest. The ability to service debt is what keeps companies out of bankruptcy. Over the past several years, many risky companies issued large amounts of debt, in part in reaction to super low borrowing rates. As the chart below makes clear, junk credits \u2013 highly risky companies \u2013 had access to loans at rates below 5%, an unheard of lending rate for these riskiest of firms.\\n\\n![KDP High Yield Bond Index](/images/articles/image2.jpg \\"KDP High Yield Bond Index\\")\\n\\nNow, amid clear evidence that nearly all companies will face sharp declines in sales, these already high-risk companies will have enormous difficulty coming up with enough cash to make interest payments. And here is where the machinery makes a bad situation much worse. Much of the debt incurred by risky companies was short duration\u2014in other words, the loan was something like a two-year loan, and would need to be refinanced when it came due. For example, a company that borrowed $120 million at 5% would need to make $500,000 per month payments. If that company had to refinance today, at the current 10% rate, their monthly payment would jump to $1 million. So the firm would have greatly reduced revenues and a doubled debt service \u2013 assuming it could borrow at all. Bankruptcy is a very likely outcome.\\n\\nWhat do firms, left to their own devices and facing default, do? They fire employees with abandon, to hoard cash while hoping for a rebound for sales. When one company does this, the strategy may succeed. But if this becomes a systemic response, it is completely self-defeating. In effect, Wall Street worries\u2014servicing debts\u2014generate a wave of firing. Sales on Main Street worsen, as fired workers pull back on spending. This worsens company sales, and raises bankruptcy risks, invoking more firing. This adverse feedback loop poses a serious additional threat to the U.S. and global economy. Even if the pandemic miraculously recedes, we need to prevent a debt/deflation depression from taking hold.\\n\\n#### So, another Bailout for Wall Street?\\n\\nWriting checks to companies, to stem bankruptcies, sounds an awful lot like the response to the financial crisis of 2008-2009. The bailout on this occasion will be more to Main Street than to Wall Street, and because the crisis was not caused by mistakes by U.S. firms, concerns about moral hazard should be second order. The Senate has agreed on a $2 trillion package that will cushion the blow. It does not, and cannot, avoid a sharp contraction in economic activity in the second quarter. If goods and services are not being produced, they do not show up in GDP. But it will make the contraction smaller than it would otherwise have been. More importantly, it keeps the firms going, which makes it possible to have an economic recovery when the shock eventually passes. It is expensive, and is only part of how the deficit will explode, with reduced tax revenue and automatic stabilizers being another large part. But there is the fiscal space to do this, and it gets us through then near-term effects of the virus without economic catastrophe.\\n\\n#### And beyond the next few months?\\n\\nWe are all praying for a material payoff, in terms of flattening the pandemic curve, over the months immediately ahead, and the widespread consensus among epidemiologists is that we need at least a couple of months of social distancing to stem the pandemic. If economic policies are aggressive and put in place quickly, the economic costs can be managed.\\n\\nBut beyond the very near term, the lockdowns will have to be eased at least to some extent. Farms, for example, need to keep producing, and that will mean workers are needed. We can get along for quite a while without new cars, houses or even clothing. Food is something else.\\n\\nAll of this suggests to us that around summer, a second calculation will have to be made. A multi-month lockdown \u2013 whether driven by federal authorities or state and local leaders \u2013 with central bank cash infusions and enormous federal fiscal stimulus can hopefully flatten the COVID-19 curve while also averting economic disaster. It is, however, nearly impossible to sketch out a strategy to keep the economy afloat, amid the possibility of a lockdown in place into the fall or 2021, when it is hoped a vaccine will become available.\\n\\nA yearlong lockdown would guarantee major supply disruptions. Bankruptcies will dominate, the jobless rate will exceed Great Depression levels, and there is nothing that monetary or fiscal stimulus can do to avert this scenario. In such circumstances, deaths from the indirect effects of the economic catastrophe would soar, not to mention the other human costs of mass unemployment.\\n\\nThe U.S. was not well prepared, going into this pandemic. However, appropriately aggressive monetary and fiscal stimulus can buy some time to get more ventilators, more test kits, and more intensive care capacity. It also allows epidemiologists to get more data on the spread of the virus and its mortality rate. With enough test kits, randomized testing of the general population might give us very important information. That information may help us do some grim math. To get the economy moving again will require people to, well, move again. There will be health costs to doing that, and difficult tradeoffs to face. The decisions will not be easy ones.","legacyIsNew":null,"isDrafted":null,"order":null,"date":"","attachments":[],"verticals":[],"authors":[]},{"id":97,"slug":"state-data-reporting-reduction-continues-amidst-covid-19-resurgence","meta":{"path":"/pandemic-data-initiative/news/state-data-reporting-reduction-continues-amidst-covid-19-resurgence","title":"State Data Reporting Reduction Continues Amidst COVID-19 Resurgence","description":"States continue to reduce their reporting cadence and shut down dashboards as COVID-19 surges in the United States, driven by the Delta variant.","image":"/images/assets/Cadence_Viz_Meta_and_Title_8830cd444a.jpg"},"section":"Pandemic Data Outlook","title":"State Data Reporting Reduction Continues Amidst COVID-19 Resurgence","subtitle":null,"caption":"About 70% of U.S. states do not release updated COVID-19 data daily. As cases and deaths continue to rise, states need to reinstate near real-time reporting of data to protect the public\u2019s health during the pandemic.","content":"Two months ago, [we highlighted the fact that states were reducing their data reporting frequency](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/pandemic-data-initiative/news/we-need-a-daily-data-dump), minimizing the availability and quality of public data about COVID-19. Believing the pandemic was settling down, states closed their COVID-19 online dashboards or dramatically reduced reporting with little public attention. But the highly contagious Delta variant and diminishing vaccination coverage led to uncontrolled spread, high rates of hospitalizations in unvaccinated populations, and increased cases and deaths across the country \u2014 ushering in a new phase of the pandemic, worse than the winter peak in many locations.  \\n\\nAs has been the case throughout the pandemic, decision makers at all levels need more public data, not less, to properly assess the state of the outbreak, forecast future conditions, and plan response efforts accordingly. Obscuring the reality of this phase of COVID-19 is dangerous, and could lead to deadly outcomes.  \\n\\nFor some perspective, when we released our first blog on state reporting cadences in June, there were about 100,000 new cases in the United States. Twenty-one states had stopped reporting COVID-19 data on the weekends, and only three states were reporting less frequently. Cases have increased 9-fold to over 900,000 new cases last week, and states continue to reduce their reporting cadences. As of today, 36 states do not update their dashboards with all data streams every day, and 11 states report fewer than five days a week. Six states report certain data only once a week, and Nebraska has even shut down its state dashboard.<sup>1</sup>\\n\\n![Cadence-Viz.jpg]()  \\n\\nTo help the public visualize these changes, [the Coronavirus Resource Center has today released a new tracker to expose state reporting cadences for each type of COVID-19 data](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/state-reporting-frequencies) (shown above for new cases). We hope that this new tool will encourage states to resume regular reporting, as Alabama<sup>2</sup>, Arkansas<sup>3</sup>, and South Dakota<sup>4</sup> recently did. The information should also help strengthen the public demand for more frequent and better COVID-19 data<sup>5, 6</sup> as people are forced to continue making critical decisions about their safety and that of their families.  \\n\\nWe at the CRC have a simple belief: **states should provide residents with the most accurate and complete data possible during a global pandemic.** Throughout this pandemic the need for data transparency and availability has only become more obvious, but the opacity of data streams continues to increase. Earlier in the pandemic, states showed they have the infrastructure and capacity to report data daily. However, instead of investing in sustaining the infrastructure already established, states are, more often, scaling back.  With states reducing public reporting, the federal government, via the CDC, must receive updated data through official (non-public) reports directly from the states, which may result in a lag or inconsistencies with state public reporting.<sup>7</sup>  \\n\\nAt the CRC we exclusively use publicly available data from states. Infrequent reporting results in data that is increasingly messy and difficult to interpret. We have previously spoken to the need for temporal granularity with data (shown with Michigan hospitalization data [in the blog here](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/pandemic-data-initiative/news/we-need-a-daily-data-dump)), as it enables leaders to make critical decisions as quickly as possible.<sup>8</sup> As shown below, when reporting cadence drops to once weekly with no date metainformation, the data cannot be distributed over the whole week, producing data spikes after multi-day plateaus that are alarming, misleading, and uninformed. These data gaps limit the ability of modelers and decision makers to optimally plan for and respond to the needs of the states and cities affected.  \\n\\n![Florida-Case-Data-modified.jpg]()  \\n\\nAt present, we are losing the granularity that our current rate of transmission demands.  The lack of data erodes public trust in the government institutions that strive to keep us safe, and reduces the ability to analyze data and devise the most strategic public health response. The motto of the United States Department of Health and Human Services is: \u201cImproving the health, safety, and well-being of America.\u201d Most state health departments operate under a similar motto or creed. Reducing the public\u2019s access to real-time data during an unprecedented crisis serves neither health, safety, nor well-being of anyone and certainly doesn\u2019t reflect the core values that are at the center of our public health systems.  \\n\\nCOVID-19 cases and deaths continue to rise in the United States, and vaccination rates remain insufficient to claim any hope for herd immunity in the near future. Millions of unprotected children are heading back to classrooms this fall amidst some of our most rapidly growing infections. Shutting down dashboards and reducing the amount of data available will not change the reality of those figures. We implore states that have reduced their reporting cadences to resume daily data reporting. Closing our eyes isn\u2019t going to make this pandemic go away. States that do not provide daily data on COVID-19 are doing the world, and the American people, a disservice.  \\n\\n---  \\n\\nReferences  \\n1. P. Ricketts, Gov.

To learn about the challenges this raises for low- and middle-income countries during the COVID-19 pandemic, Samuel Volkin, MPH/MBA candidate, turned to [Jeremy Shiffman](https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/3666/jeremy-shiffman), Bloomberg Distinguished Professor of Global Health Policy at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the School of Advanced International Studies. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\\n\\n**Why is it important to have strong national health information systems during COVID-19?**\\n\\nShiffman: In this era of pandemic, data are essential to understand where the disease is occurring and to craft national policy. This information is needed to undertake appropriate responses to the pandemic, including how to allocate resources to provide medical care. Data collected by these systems is also needed to create models that can predict the future course of the pandemic. Data from health information systems are a crucial component of any country\u2019s response. \\n\\n**Are national health information systems in low- and middle-income countries adequately developed to respond to COVID-19?**\\n\\nI have concerns about the strength of health information systems in many settings, including low-income countries. Many of these systems are not as strong as we would hope. This may make it very difficult to monitor the course of the pandemic in these places. That\u2019s worrying. There\u2019s going to be large variance in the capabilities of national health information systems to respond to COVID-19. Some may be strong, but some countries have very weak information systems in place, making it more difficult to contain an outbreak. \\n\\n**Why are health information systems weaker in some countries despite the ongoing need to address global health challenges?**\\n\\nThere are many reasons. My recent [paper](https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2820%2930416-5) in the Lancet posits that one\u2014if not the only\u2014reason for this may be the unintended effects of global health metrics initiatives that use imputation methods to estimate disease burden in low-income settings. Global health metrics uncover health problems and bring greater accountability to advance the well-being of populations in low-income settings. However, some health ministries and statistical agencies in low-income countries may have decided that it\u2019s just not worth investing extensively in their own information systems if estimates are already being produced globally by organizations using massive computer power. It\u2019s costly to develop these statistics locally, so they sometimes give up.

Herd immunity, vaccines, and COVID-19: A Q&A with Dr. Bill Moss","subtitle":null,"caption":"Dr. Bill Moss, *Professor and Executive Director of the International Vaccine Access Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health*","content":"As researchers continue to learn more about the novel coronavirus, a critical goal has been understanding how the immune system recovers from COVID-19, and how long any potential immunity might last. Recent anecdotes circulating in news and social media about individuals becoming infected with COVID-19 twice pose new questions for epidemiologists and immunologists as the scientific community works to develop a vaccine for the virus and as some speculate about what it would take to achieve herd immunity. To understand what we know thus far about immunity and COVID-19 \u2013 and where researchers are headed \u2013 we caught up with Dr. Bill Moss, Professor and Executive Director of the International Vaccine Access Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\\n\\n**What does it mean for someone to be immune from an infectious disease?**\\n\\nImmunity from an infectious disease means the body\u2019s immune system has previously responded to the pathogen \u2013 which is often a bacteria or a virus \u2013 that causes the infection. This happens either from infection with the pathogen itself or from a vaccine. Then, when someone is re-exposed to the pathogen, they don\u2019t get sick. However, it\u2019s more of a spectrum than an absolute, as there are different levels of immunity. A strong immune response may prevent infection, but most immune responses prevent disease. \\n\\n**Once someone recovers from a novel coronavirus infection, are they then immune from the virus? **\\n\\nYes, on some level\u2014and that\u2019s the key question: how strong is the immunity and how long does it last? Right now, we don\u2019t know. We do have some evidence that recovered patients will be immune; we just don\u2019t know for how long. The next step is to identify individuals who\u2019ve had a confirmed COVID-19 infection, have recovered, and then test negative for the virus. If these individuals then get re-exposed, we\u2019ll be able to see if they also become re-infected. \\n\\nObviously, that\u2019s not easy to do and it takes time. For one thing, the exposure part is hard to measure. One potential solution is to study healthcare workers because they\u2019re already at high risk of re-exposure due to their work. However, it\u2019s hard to test and see if they\u2019ve not been infected, and it\u2019s even harder to show they were exposed but not infected. \\n\\nOne trick we can use to assess whether a person was exposed to the virus is to see if they have an increase in their antibody levels. If there\u2019s a jump in antibodies, you can then assume that the immune system has seen the virus. If they\u2019re also symptom free, then that\u2019s a good sign that they\u2019ve fought off a second infection, but it\u2019s tricky to demonstrate it. \\n\\nAnother consideration is that people who have a mild or asymptomatic infection could also have a lower immunity level. There\u2019s already some evidence for this idea. We also know that in animal and monkey models, a certain level and type of antibody response correlates with immunity and protection \u2013 so a more severe infection might lead to a higher immunity level. We haven\u2019t proven it yet, but we have a good idea based on our knowledge of how other viral infections work.\\n\\nFor other coronaviruses, we do know immunity doesn\u2019t last very long, maybe on the order of months to years.  \\n\\n**Do people who have recovered from a COVID-19 infection still need to maintain public health measures like staying home, keeping six feet apart, washing their hands, and wearing masks?**\\n\\nYes, absolutely. The biggest reason is because, to answer this question definitively, we need to know the duration of a person\u2019s protective immunity from COVID-19. Essentially, after someone has recovered, can they get re-infected and, if so, are they potentially contagious to other people? Right now, the presumptive answer is probably not, but until we can say for sure we all need to follow the public health guidelines.\\n\\nThe other part of this question we need to answer is: are people who have recovered fully protected, or are they susceptible to reinfection? Until we really know for sure, it\u2019s probably safest for those individuals to maintain measures like physical distancing and wearing masks.\\n\\n**There have been anecdotal cases of people who continued to test positive even after they recover. How unusual is this for an infectious disease?  Are there other possible explanations?**\\n\\nThere\u2019s some interesting work being done that shows how people who\u2019ve recovered can still test positive on a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test, that is with a molecular test that detects the virus RNA, even several months later. The belief is that they\u2019re not still contagious, but they still have remnants of the virus in their system. It\u2019s an interesting phenomenon \u2013 and one we\u2019ve seen in other viruses, like measles virus, but it\u2019s something we need to understand more fully.\\n\\nThere are some viral infections that are well known and that do cause what we call a \u201cpersistent infection,\u201d like HIV, hepatitis C, and chickenpox, for example. So, we do know that certain viruses can persist, but coronaviruses are a subset that does not behave that way, as far as we know. They\u2019re much more likely to cause a classic acute viral infection: you become infected, recover, and are then immune. We have learned that a virus \u2013 or part of it \u2013 can still be detected up to months later, but that\u2019s not the same as a persistent infection.\\n\\nWhat\u2019s interesting about this is that other viruses have shown similar attributes. Like I mentioned, measles is an interesting corollary. It\u2019s the classic acute viral infection: you get it, recover or die \u2013 and if you recover the virus clears quickly within days, granting the survivor lifelong immunity. But as a study I was a part of showed, children in Zambia who had measles could still have the virus turn up on a PCR test a month to three months later, much to our surprise. We have a lot of unanswered questions to still nail down around this \u2013 are the tests responding to stray pieces of RNA? Or is there a low level of viral replication going on? We\u2019re still learning about it.\\n\\nFor SARS-CoV-2, right now it\u2019s especially hard to tease out exactly whether people are experiencing a new viral infection or a persistent remnant. For a reinfection, we would have to see someone become symptomatic again and become sick, and we would have to genotype the virus to see if it\u2019s the same virus or a different virus. I would say that most people testing positive within three months of a prior infection \u2013 that\u2019s probably a remnant of viral RNA and not a reinfection, but it\u2019s important to distinguish between the two.\\n\\n**How does a vaccine bring about immunity?**\\n\\nA vaccine mimics the body\u2019s immune response to a natural infection, but without the dangers of the actual disease. For COVID-19, there are multiple types of vaccines in development right now, and though they all work quite differently, the goal is the same: to show the immune system an aspect of COVID-19 \u2013 which is most commonly the spike protein on the surface of the virus that it uses to gain entry into human cells. The body\u2019s immune system then learns to bind to that spike protein and prevent it from entering the body\u2019s cells. It differs from a \u201cnatural\u201d infection because it avoids the peril of a serious infection from something like COVID-19. A fully tested and approved vaccine might cause some tenderness, muscle aches, or mild fever, but nothing as severe as a natural infection from a virus like COVID-19.\\u2028\\n\\n**What is herd immunity and how could it be achieved for COVID-19?**\\n\\nHerd immunity is a level of population immunity where transmission begins to slow instead of accelerating, and that\u2019s what we really need to truly slow the spread of this novel coronavirus. It\u2019s a reasonable goal if we have a safe, effective vaccine and if it is widely accepted by the public. Take measles, again, as an example \u2013 it\u2019s much more contagious and requires a really high level of vaccine use by the public, which is what makes it so hard to control and eliminate. Let\u2019s say for COVID-19 we need 50% to 70% of the population to be immune in order to reach herd immunity \u2013 and that\u2019s just a guess \u2013 then that\u2019s a lot more achievable than needing to have 95% of people immune to keep the population safe from measles. Still, there are a lot of \u201cifs\u201d in that idea, like the existence of a safe vaccine and a willingness for the public to take the vaccine, and there are already some signs of resistance to people taking the vaccine.\\n\\nAnother thing about herd immunity \u2013\xa0and it\u2019s one thing that makes COVID-19 particularly interesting \u2013 is that you have to sustain that herd immunity threshold over time because new susceptible people come from births. So, for a disease like measles, the infection of young children is what keeps the virus going. What\u2019s promising then about COVID-19 is that, thus far, it has caused fewer active infections among young children, and it may even be less transmissible by them. If that\u2019s the case, it\u2019ll make it easier to hit that herd immunity threshold and bring the transmission rate down. It could mean that new births, in the next few years, might not contribute as much to transmission, which would allow for better herd immunity.\\n\\nUnfortunately, all of these issues are pretty complex. But I think we\u2019ll learn a lot about immunity to this particular virus from the phase 3 vaccine trials that are just starting up, as of late July. It\u2019ll give us a lot of insight about immunity and its duration, and we\u2019ll also start to learn more from the studies that are following up on confirmed infections. By the end of the year, we\u2019ll simply know a lot more about how the immune system responds to the virus, and the more we learn about the virus the closer we\u2019ll be to finding safe, effective vaccines. \\n","legacyIsNew":null,"isDrafted":null,"order":null,"date":"","attachments":[],"verticals":[],"authors":[]},{"id":22,"slug":"the-messenger-rna-vaccines-and-masks","meta":{"path":"/vaccines/blog/the-messenger-rna-vaccines-and-masks","title":"The messenger RNA vaccines and masks","description":"COVID-19 VACCINE MATTERS: A blog series discussing the evolving science and policy of COVID-19 vaccines, led by internationally renowned experts in vaccine development, Dr. Larry Corey of the Univeristy of Washington, and Dr. Chris Beyrer of Johns Hopkins University.","image":"/images/assets/JHU-Blog-Brand-JHUUW-02_0c03ab0ec1.jpeg"},"section":"Vaccine Blogs","title":"The messenger RNA vaccines and masks","subtitle":"","caption":"*The views and opinions expressed here are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the position of either Johns Hopkins University and Medicine or the University of Washington.*","content":"Key Points:\\n- Current phase 3 trials tell us whether COVID-19 vaccines prevent illness and hospitalization, but not whether the vaccines prevent infection and transmission.\\n- Despite the excitement around reports of high vaccine efficacy, we will still need to wear masks, physically distance, wash our hands frequently, and avoid large gatherings when a vaccine becomes available until we know more about the ability of the vaccine to stop virus spread.\\n- Additional studies will need to be done, perhaps within households and on college campuses, to see whether COVID-19 vaccines prevent virus transmission, allowing us to return to a more normal life.  \\n\\nIn the messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine trials, COVID-19 vaccines are primarily being tested to determine whether they prevent a person from getting sick, from having a prolonged illness, or hospitalization. Importantly, these clinical trials are not focused on whether a vaccine prevents someone from getting the virus at all. In other words, a COVID-19 vaccine may benefit the individual who gets vaccinated, but the virus may still invade the body and it\u2019s possible \u2013 if not likely \u2013 that a vaccinated person can still spread the virus to others. This is a critical distinction that has received little attention.  \\n\\nIf you think about it, infecting someone without them knowing it is a great strategy for a virus whose goal is to \u201creplicate and survive.\u201d HIV is a master of this approach. The HIV virus infects most people while causing minimal symptoms, and persists for years before an individual develops AIDS, and all the while HIV can spread through sexual contact. SARS-CoV-2 differs from HIV in that it\u2019s most infectious in the first few days after acquiring it, and it has explosive infectivity for a few days until the body\u2019s immune response starts to kick in. And, SARS-CoV-2 isn\u2019t transmitted through sex but by less intimate interactions such as talking and sneezing; it\u2019s just way more infectious in a short period of time. Get close \u2013 inches \u2013 to someone who\u2019s infected and SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious; a few feet away markedly less. Wear a mask and it\u2019s a heck of a lot less risky.  \\n\\nSo, enter a vaccine. What does it do to this dynamic? Answer\u2026 we don\u2019t know yet. If I get vaccinated, do I lessen my risk of actually getting infected? Will I walk around with the virus and not know it? Do I still shed the virus from my nose? Is it at the same level as if I were not vaccinated at all? For the same duration? Could I be one of those super-spreaders without me knowing that I am sick? Will we have hundreds of vaccinated people walking around with the virus unknowingly, putting the unvaccinated at an even higher risk of contracting COVID-19? In medical terms: will vaccinated persons be asymptomatic carriers who can still transmit throughout their household, their community, their school? It\u2019s what we call onward transmission.  \\n\\nThese questions are of obvious importance. If vaccinated individuals are capable of transmitting infection, then anybody who is not vaccinated fares no differently before than after the introduction of a COVID-19 vaccine. With vaccine hesitancy resulting in fewer people agreeing to be vaccinated, we do not yet know whether and when we will be able to markedly reduce the public health implications of COVID-19 and reduce its circulation in the workplace, in close communities, and stop super-spreading events. With the promise of a vaccine, many continue to ask: will I still have to wear that damn mask? And the answer to this is: until we know more\u2026yes.  \\n\\nThe way we generally look at a vaccine preventing infection is whether a vaccinated person makes an antibody and \u2013 if they don\u2019t get infected throughout an entire trial \u2013 we look at their antibodies pre- and post-vaccination. We have tests that determine whether the placebo groups get asymptomatically infected more than the vaccine groups. For example, the most common respiratory virus vaccine \u2013 influenza vaccine \u2013 sometimes prevents someone from getting clinical flu but doesn\u2019t often prevent infection. Put differently, one can still acquire the infection even after getting vaccinated. Preventing infection entirely is usually considered to be a higher hurdle for a vaccine.  \\n\\nSo, at this point, we do not know \u2013 even with the high efficacy reported in reducing symptomatic disease \u2013 whether after vaccination individuals are still infectious. Once a vaccine is available, do we need to be careful about whom we invite to our home for dinner? Do we need to continue to wear masks with other people around, especially casual acquaintances or strangers? At the moment, the answer is still yes until we unravel these issues.  \\n\\n**Mathematical modelers: vaccination and reduction in transmission**  \\n\\nMathematicians have modeled and made predictions about COVID-19, and they have envisioned all sorts of scenarios. And, one scenario they have created imagines that if we have a vaccine that makes everybody asymptomatic, but individuals still remain infectious, then whoa! We may actually end up with more people who get infected!  \\n\\nScenarios like these raise the concern that a lot of people will not get vaccinated and they will get infected. We will still see a lot of hospitalizations due to COVID-19. There will still be deaths. This realization helps explain why we must optimize coverage and overcome vaccine hesitancy, especially in persons who are at high risk. Because we certainly are going to see behavioral changes once people get vaccinated. They\u2019ll think, \u201cI got vaccinated, why do I need to wear a mask?\u201d So, those modelers, they\u2019ve forewarned us that we do need to learn about infectivity after vaccination.   \\n\\nIn the end, to answer the mask or no mask question, we need to do a study, and that\u2019s where I am today. Discussing the issue and advocating for a study. Households and college campuses, I think, are a good place to consider for this \u2013 where we can vaccinate and sample people every other day and see if they acquire COVID-19. And if they do, what\u2019s the amount of virus? Then, we can do some contact tracing to see if people spread it to their roommates and classmates, because colleges are starting to do this anyway. Let\u2019s piggyback on this thing. Try and do a vaccine study and answer the question: mask or no mask? Please tell me \u2013 do *you* think we should do this?

The recent surge of COVID-19 cases throughout the U.S., the continued alteration in our daily lives, and the increase in hospitalizations and the COVID-19 death rate all hopefully counterbalance vaccine hesitancy with a desire to be protected from this sinister virus.  \\n\\nWanting an effective vaccine during an ongoing pandemic is, from a public health point of view, a \u201cgood\u201d perspective. Unfortunately, however, the demand for COVID-19 vaccines will markedly outstrip their supply, at least for the next four to five months, which seems like an eternity given the distressing trends we are now seeing. Vaccine scarcity will be in the news for the next several months until one or two additional vaccines meet the requirements for an EUA and become widely available. How does this happen, that two effective vaccines are found but we can\u2019t deliver them to everyone?  \\n\\nWhat has happened in the battle against this virus is that the pace of vaccine development has been unbelievably quick; quicker than anyone ever expected. This remarkable scientific accomplishment has outstripped the existing manufacturing supply chain. The conceptual framework of a victory against the virus exists but, in order to proclaim victory, we need mass vaccine manufacturing, distribution, and real uptake.  \\n\\nMaking and distributing safe and effective vaccines is a complex process. There are many steps, and each step requires detailed quality control measures to ensure that each and every vial contains the right dose and right substance. To think of it in a more personalized way, what goes into every arm \u2013 including yours and mine \u2013 needs to meet manufacturing standards. This is not an easy task; it takes specialized facilities and highly trained personnel, beyond what currently exist.  \\n\\nWhen we look at the number of doses being made versus what we need, it\u2019s a daunting thought: between Pfizer and Moderna we expect only 40 million doses in December; another 30 to 40 million in January and February; and 60 million per month in March and April. Because each vaccine requires two doses per person, even if we reach 200 million doses, that\u2019s 100 million people vaccinated at best \u2013 only half of the U.S. adult population. As I\u2019ll describe below, these doses may not even cover the populations we feel most need the vaccine.\\n  \\nSo, who\u2019s in line for this scarce resource and who decides who gets vaccinated first? We knew that vaccine scarcity would be inevitable since the beginning of the Operation Warp Speed (OWS) program, so independent groups and other experts have been evaluating how to define and develop an equitable national vaccine access strategy. The National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine, the country\u2019s independent group of scientists and medical policy makers, was commissioned by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), CDC, and OWS to evaluate this issue.  \\n\\nThis group of experts divided access to effective vaccines into [four categories](https://www.nap.edu/resource/25917/FIGURE%20-%20A%20Phased%20Approach%20to%20Vaccine%20Allocation%20for%20COVID-19.pdf) and estimated the number of people in each of these categories. In the first phase, they prioritized health care workers and the elderly in high density communities, such as nursing homes, followed by the elderly that have comorbidities. They classified essential workers as the second group. In both situations, they stressed the importance that economically disadvantaged communities be given equal access in all situations.  \\n\\nThe second group of experts enlisted was the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which is the CDC\u2019s arm for making vaccine recommendations for the country. For over 50 years, the ACIP has defined populations recommended for vaccination, and its advice is linked to public health-funded programs and insurance coverage for vaccines. ACIP has been discussing this issue for many weeks in open meetings, and on December 1 suggested that health care personnel and residents of long-term care facilities should be the [first group](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2020-12/COVID-02-Dooling.pdf) to receive a vaccine. Essential workers comprise group 1B, for example grocery store workers and meatpackers, and the third priority group (1C) is the elderly and those people with comorbidities. These 3 groups alone comprise well over 150 million people, which is much higher than the estimated 90 million people we will have enough vaccine for by April 2021.\\n  \\nHow does one handle this scarcity when a case for vaccination exists for a very large segment of our adult population? How does one choose between a healthy frontline worker with no comorbidities \u2013 who has a lower risk of death but a higher exposure rate (and the potential consequences of being in quarantine and unavailable for their duties) \u2013 and an elderly person with comorbidities who has a much higher risk of death but could perhaps self-protect more by limiting exposure? Is there a right answer to who gets vaccinated first? Or do we have to consider some principles of equity and patience and, in the end, do what we can to make sure that everyone who wants a vaccine has access to one as quickly as possible? \\n\\nBoth groups \u2013 the National Academy of Medicine and the ACIP \u2013 are advisory. They make recommendations to the public and executive branches of state governments, but we don\u2019t have a national plan. We have national guidelines, but each state will make its own decision about allocation, so we will see differences in distribution by locale. Understanding and communicating these differences to the public will be challenging and some will call it confusing. I\u2019m sure there will be some disagreement about who should get the vaccine and when.  \\n\\nOne principle should be upheld: we should use every available vial. Nothing should be wasted.  \\n\\nThe only real solution to overcome vaccine scarcity is, of course, to remove scarcity, and move toward full vaccine availability for all who choose to be vaccinated. This means that additional vaccines will need to be made available. So, the AstraZeneca vaccine that you\u2019ve heard about \u2013 which reports a 70% effectiveness \u2013 the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine and others must be studied and continue to be evaluated. We are hopeful that answers about how these additional vaccines perform in the U.S. will be known by late January 2021 \u2013 only two months away. For the time being, we need to get used to this reality of vaccine scarcity. However difficult it may be, we must have tolerance until more manufacturing capacity for the mRNA vaccines exists, or more likely, other types of vaccines become available for all of us.

These efforts have, in turn, spurred important questions: how do we know these policies are working? And how effective are these policies at stopping the spread of the coronavirus? To learn more about how researchers measure the impact and effectiveness of policy decisions like these, we spoke with Elizabeth Stuart, Bloomberg Professor of American Health and Professor of Biostatistics, Mental Health, and Health Policy and Management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\\n\\n\\n**What is evidence-based policy, and what does it mean in the context of Covid-19?**\\n\\nIn general, evidence-based policy means using data and evidence to inform policy decisions. This can cover a variety of different things in a number of different fields. Evidence-based policy often looks to inform interventions. Essentially, it asks the question, \u201cIf we implement this policy, will it lead to a better future than if it was not implemented?\u201d Outside of Covid-19, evidence-based policy can also include monitoring, such as using data to track issues that are impacting a community, like violence or unemployment, and identify which issues need attention. With Covid-19, it can mean using epidemiologic data \u2013\xa0essentially data about how a disease is spreading in a community \u2013 to inform policies intended to stop that spread. In this moment, we see virus case counts going up in some places, so evidence-based policy might ask, \u201cIf we implement widespread testing or contact tracing, is that going to have an impact on what will happen in the future?\u201d Right now, we\u2019re still in the middle of it.\\n\\n**What challenges arise for researchers who evaluate Covid-related policies?**\\n\\nIn terms of evaluation, one big picture challenge is that it\u2019s hard to figure out what is the true impact of a policy and what is natural variation that you can\u2019t attribute to a given policy. For Covid-19, a significant challenge has been that it\u2019s a very dynamic situation. The easiest policy evaluations are in scenarios where things were \u201cflat\u201d before and, after a new policy is implemented, we want to determine whether there\u2019s a big, measurable change, relative to what we see in places without the policy change. With Covid-19, we don\u2019t have this sort of natural state or a stable situation of cases over time to compare things to. So, disentangling policy impacts from these natural trends has been tricky.\\n\\nWith policy evaluation in general, the easiest policies to assess are those that have a quick, immediate effect. Take a policy like seatbelt laws\u2014once it was implemented, it had a quick impact on motor vehicle deaths. That is very measurable. Covid-19 is much more dynamic, with a long lag time between exposure and outcomes such as hospitalization; this makes it hard to find the real impact of the policy.\\n\\nThe other complication is data. As has been widely reported in the media, we don\u2019t have uniform standards for consistently reported data at the moment. Ideally, for policy evaluation, we\u2019d have high-quality data showing us the complete number of cases and deaths over time. But because of the limitations of testing, and even collecting data at the local level, it\u2019s hard to know if the data we have access to gives us an accurate representation. One small example is death certificates. If someone dies at home and their death was due to Covid-19, it might not be labeled as such on the certificate, which is just one thing that\u2019s hard to account for.\\n\\n**What would a robust evaluation of Covid-19 policies look like?**\\n\\nIdeally, we would want to have multiple communities that adopted the policy under study and multiple communities that did not, which would give us a good comparison for what would have happened with and without the policy. What\u2019s key is collecting good longitudinal data from all of those places, which basically means data collected over time and space. For example, this could be something like different communities\u2019 daily Covid-19 death counts over a certain period of time. Collecting repeated data points that we can see over time can show a change, like an increase or decrease in new cases, and across locations\u2014say fewer deaths in a community with the policy than in one without the policy.\\n\\nI\u2019d also look for studies that incorporated the epidemiological knowledge about the disease. That means considering features of the virus that can influence the way a policy works, for instance the incubation period of the disease, where it can take up to fourteen days for people to have symptoms. A stronger evaluation would take this into account.\\n\\nFor the strongest design, we\u2019d like to consider communities that are similar to each other before the policy change was made. For example, two cities (but ideally, many cities) that look similar to one another in terms of trends in the disease and demographics, where one (or some) implemented the policy but others didn\u2019t.\\n\\nIt\u2019s important, too, for evaluations to take into account sensitivity analysis, essentially reflecting on how a model is set up and how it runs. Sensitivity analysis is the way that researchers explore how robust their findings are based on the model\u2019s assumptions and choices. These assumptions inform the model, and sensitivity analysis allows you to look at how those assumptions will affect both your results and your model. In a medical setting, the gold standard is a randomized trial, where randomized patients receive one of two treatments\u2014it gives a really strong result. With policy evaluation, we\u2019re not in a clinic but out in the world. It\u2019s a non-experimental setting in that way, and it\u2019s not randomized: some communities take an action and some communities don\u2019t. In any non-experimental setting there are assumptions you have to make. \\n\\n**Public consumption of data has become a hallmark of Covid-19. Is the media doing a good job of helping the public to understand Covid-related data and modeling?**\\n\\nWe recently wrote an article about [10 tips](https://www.jhsph.edu/covid-19/articles/10-tips-for-making-sense-of-covid-19-models-for-decision-making.html) for better understanding Covid-19 models. But generally, I think there are some examples of really high quality reporting and thoughtful discussion of the challenges. \\n\\nStatisticians are generally concerned about the challenges of understanding and conveying uncertainty. The current crisis has heighted uncertainty for all of us, so stories that can highlight, in a very clear way, what is known and isn\u2019t known, as well as the underlying facts that inform our policies, will help people understand the moment better. It will show that we don\u2019t have the answers right now, and not overstating what we know is really important.\\n\\n**Do you think Covid-19 has changed the way the public thinks about public health and data?\\u2028**\\n\\nIt\u2019s been a remarkable time to be a statistician in public health. Never before have I had friends and family asking me questions about statistics and the way we measure policy effectiveness. While it\u2019s an unprecedented time for the field, you can\u2019t overstate the scale of tragedy the pandemic has caused. But it\u2019s also shown the public the value of public health, and many institutions, including Hopkins, have set a nice example of using evidence-based science to inform decision-making at all levels, from the individual to the national. \\n\\nI really hope that Covid-19 research is an area where different fields can work together. A lot of fields have different tools to aid in policy evaluation, from statistics to economics to political science. I\u2019d love to see these groups working in partnership with our colleagues who are studying the disease itself, because we\u2019ll need all these groups to contribute for us to have a response to the virus that is valid, meaningful, and useful.","legacyIsNew":null,"isDrafted":null,"order":null,"date":"","attachments":[],"verticals":[],"authors":[]},{"id":9,"slug":"early-herd-immunity-against-covid-19-a-dangerous-misconception","meta":{"path":"/from-our-experts/early-herd-immunity-against-covid-19-a-dangerous-misconception","title":"Early Herd Immunity against COVID-19: A Dangerous Misconception","description":"Bloomberg School of Public Health epidemiologists David Dowdy and Gypsyamber D\'Souza explain the misconceptions around herd immunity as we discuss when and how to phase in re-opening.","image":""},"section":"","title":"Early Herd Immunity against COVID-19: A Dangerous Misconception","subtitle":null,"caption":"David Dowdy, *Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health*  \\nGypsyamber D\u2019Souza, *Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health*","content":"We have listened with concern to voices erroneously suggesting that herd immunity may \u201csoon slow the spread\u201d<sup>1</sup> of COVID-19. For example, Rush Limbaugh<sup>2</sup> recently claimed that \u201cherd immunity has occurred in California.\u201d As infectious disease epidemiologists, we wish to state clearly that herd immunity against COVID-19 will not be achieved at a population level in 2020, barring a public health catastrophe. \\n\\nAlthough more than 2.5 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide, studies  suggest that (as of early April 2020) no more than 2-4%<sup>3\u20135</sup> of any country\u2019s population has been infected with SARS-CoV-2 (the coronavirus that causes COVID-19). Even in hotspots like New York City that have been hit hardest by the pandemic, initial studies suggest that perhaps 15-21%<sup>6,7</sup> of people have been exposed so far. In getting to that level of exposure, more than 17,500 of the 8.4 million people in New York City (about 1 in every 500 New Yorkers) have died, with the overall death rate in the city suggesting deaths may be undercounted and mortality may be even higher.<sup>8</sup>\\n\\nSome have entertained the idea of \u201ccontrolled voluntary infection,\u201d<sup>9</sup> akin to the \u201cchickenpox parties\u201d of the 1980s. However, COVID-19 is 100 times more lethal than the chickenpox. For example, on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, the mortality rate among those infected with SARS-CoV-2 was 1%. Someone who goes to a \u201ccoronavirus party\u201d to get infected would not only be substantially increasing their own chance of dying in the next month, they would also be putting their families and friends at risk. COVID-19 is now the leading cause of death in the United States, killing almost 2,000 Americans every day.8 Chickenpox never killed more than 150 Americans in a year.<sup>9</sup>\\n\\nTo reach herd immunity for COVID-19, likely 70% or more of the population would need to be immune. Without a vaccine, over 200 million Americans would have to get infected before we reach this threshold. Put another way, even if the current pace of the COVID-19 pandemic continues in the United States, we won\u2019t reach herd immunity in 2021. If current daily death rates continue, over half a million Americans would be dead from COVID-19 by that time. \\n\\nAs we discuss when and how to phase in re-opening,<sup>10</sup> it is important to understand how vulnerable we remain. Increased testing will help us better understand the scope of infection, but it is clear this pandemic is still only beginning to unfold.\\n\\nTo learn more about herd immunity see: https://www.jhsph.edu/covid-19/articles/achieving-herd-immunity-with-covid19.html.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, innovation has been critical to keeping many people\u2019s lives and workplaces functioning safely. Dining out at restaurants has been replaced by meal and grocery delivery services, meetings are held via video conferencing, and health care visits are occurring on our screens. But entrepreneurs also have to face the challenges of our new reality, including a global economic crisis. Christy Wyskiel, Senior Advisor to the President of Johns Hopkins University for Innovation and Entrepreneurship and Executive Director of Johns Hopkins Technology Ventures, joined Samuel Volkin to discuss impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on innovation. \\n\\n**Volkin: What is the role of entrepreneurship and innovation during the COVID-19 pandemic?**\\n\\nWyskiel: The essence of entrepreneurship is identifying an unmet need and moving as fast as possible to get a meaningful product to market. This is exactly what society needs during crisis situations like the COVID-19 pandemic. \\n\\nIf there is a silver lining to the pandemic, it\u2019s that we\u2019re seeing accelerated collaboration in a productive manner. Rather than waiting for every development detail to line up or for a grant to come in, innovators are coming together and offering their unique skills in unique collaborations. \\n\\nThis pandemic has propelled collaboration in service of society. Companies with extensive libraries of drugs are rapidly innovating, scientists who haven\u2019t historically worked together now are forging research efforts, and thought leaders are sharing ideas across fields. \\n\\n**What type of COVID-19 response have we seen from startups?**\\n\\nStartups are working on things as varied as new personal protective equipment (PPE), vaccine technology, and ways to test and trace the spread of the virus. Several Johns Hopkins startups stand out as having scaled or pivoted to meet these needs. \\n\\nOne of those companies is [emocha Mobile Health](https://emocha.com/), which for years has been working on a mobile application for disease surveillance. Over time they have tracked tuberculosis and addiction, as well as medication adherence. The Johns Hopkins Health System is now using emocha to track COVID-19 symptoms of their 7,500 doctors, nurses, and staff to determine whether they are safe to come to work. Emocha happened to be the perfectly suited solution for this scenario, and it is now being used more broadly because of the newly identified need. \\n \\nAnother startup that has risen to the occasion is [ClearMask](https://www.theclearmask.com/), which, as the name implies, makes transparent facemasks \u2013 solving a crucial accessibility challenge for deaf and hard of hearing patients. The company has seen a more than 400-fold increase in weekly orders compared to pre-COVID numbers and is planning to supply millions of masks in the coming months.\\n\\nThere is also [BurnAlong](https://www.burnalong.com/), an app used by employers to set up employee wellness programs and by gyms and fitness instructors to record and live-stream classes for clients. Whereas it typically took a week to set up a new client, the company has managed to clients onto its platform in one day to meet demand. Business has doubled this year compared to last year, and seven times as many people took classes in March compared to February. I think it is telling that more than a quarter of all classes taken are in BurnAlong\u2019s specialty and emotional support categories, which includes mental health. It was not invented or planned for this type of situation, but what a wonderful tool for folks that want to stay \u201cwell\u201d and fit.\\n\\n**How can startups scale up so quickly to meet the current need? **\\n\\nStartups are successful when they have good underlying technology and when they invest in building strong supply chain infrastructure and strong relationships with relevant partners. \\n\\nEmocha, for example, built its software, tested it in various markets, developed key clinical partnerships and a core customer base, built up patient experience with a strong focus on user-interface testing, and had solid relationships with health departments around the world. It\u2019s as if the rooms were all built in a house but the light switches weren\u2019t on \u2013 so they walked around and just started turning on the light switches in the rest of the house. \\n\\nThe beautiful thing about software is that it can be leveraged infinitely. Whether you have ten users or a million users, the core technology is the same.\\n\\n**What will the economic impact of COVID-19 mean for entrepreneurs and their startups?**\\n\\nThis is a real concern. The macro environment very much affects how companies get financed. In our world, financing is the fuel that allows innovation to happen. If a company cannot find investors, it cannot develop new software or prototypes and won\u2019t survive.\\n\\nMy concerns are based on previous macro environment situations like 9/11 and the financial crises in 2008 and 2011, when there was a clear and dramatic slowdown in venture financing. We\u2019ve seen a few of our startups meet successful financial milestones despite the crisis. Take LifeSprout, which is developing next-generation synthetic soft tissues, and just [closed $28.5M in financing](https://technical.ly/baltimore/2020/04/28/regenerative-medicine-company-lifesprout-raises-28-million-series-a/). Another startup, Tissue Analytics \u2013 a wound care platform, also closed its [acquisition in May](https://hitconsultant.net/2020/05/14/net-health-acquires-wound-care-platform-tissue-analytics/). In the long term, the strong will survive but it will be choppy waters for startups that are in the midst of raising money.\\n\\n**With double-digit unemployment rates, a looming recession, and even large businesses failing and filing for bankruptcy, what is the outlook for entrepreneurs?**\\n\\nIt\u2019s going to be a bumpy road for a while, but entrepreneurs cannot and should not be paralyzed by unpredictable events. They can set themselves up for success by continuing to serve their existing customer base and pivoting when possible to address an opportunity such as this critical pandemic. Entrepreneurs must have the end in mind to be successful. \\n\\nGood innovation has already come in response to this pandemic. In addition to the companies I mentioned, I am so gratified to see so many folks at Johns Hopkins at the forefront of this crisis. From Lauren Gardner\u2019s [COVID-19 global tracking map](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) \u2013 which has become a resource for the world \u2013 to the COVID-19 diagnostic tests being run out of the [lab of Karen Carroll and Heba Mustafa](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/coronavirus/articles/screening-test.html), this is a great moment for innovators. \\n\\n**DISCLAIMER:** The Johns Hopkins University has a financial interest in its startups. This financial interest includes equity in the company and entitlement to royalties.\\n","legacyIsNew":null,"isDrafted":null,"order":null,"date":"","attachments":[],"verticals":[],"authors":[]},{"id":14,"slug":"q-and-a-how-much-does-it-cost-to-get-a-covid-19-test-it-depends","meta":{"path":"/from-our-experts/q-and-a-how-much-does-it-cost-to-get-a-covid-19-test-it-depends","title":"Q&A: How much does it cost to get a COVID-19 test?

Testing allows public health officials to track the virus\u2019s path, understand disease prevalence, and determine the need for isolation and quarantine. As the demand for COVID-19 testing has grown, so too have questions about who bears the cost. To understand more about the nuances of insurance coverage and expenses that accompany COVID-19 testing, we reached out to Josh Sharfstein, Professor of Practice and Vice Dean for Public Health Practice and Community Engagement at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\\n\\n**How much does a viral test for COVID-19 cost?**\\n\\nThere is a [wide range](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/brief/covid-19-test-prices-and-payment-policy/) in charges. An investigation by the Kaiser Family Foundation determined that the cost of a test can range anywhere from $20 to $850, with $127 being the median cost. Currently, the Medicare reimbursement rate for a COVID-19 test is either $51 or $100, depending on the type of test offered. For those who end up paying out of pocket, there was a smaller range of $36 to $180 per test. Again, any test would also likely require additional charges for specimen collection and a physician\u2019s visit, which could potentially add to the cost significantly.\\n\\n**Does the cost vary depending on where you live?**\\n\\nYes, in part. The cost for a COVID-19 test may vary a great deal based on type of laboratory where the test is processed, region of the country, insurance provider, and other factors. This unpredictability of cost is part of the larger, fragmented healthcare system in the United States that leads to a wide variability in medical expenses.\\n\\n**Does insurance cover the costs of a COVID-19 test?**\\n\\nFederal law requires insurers to cover the costs of COVID-19 tests, but unfortunately patients are still being charged for related expenses. The law does not require insurers to cover the cost of the medical consultation or doctor\u2019s referral that may be required before a test will be administered. Another reason is that federal guidance only requires reimbursement for \u201cmedically appropriate\u201d testing. An insurance provider might decide that certain types of testing (such as testing after a trip) may not be considered \u201cmedically appropriate.\u201d\\n\\n**What about the uninsured?**\\n\\nThe federal government has provided a [path](https://www.hrsa.gov/CovidUninsuredClaim/) for reimbursement for COVID-related testing and treatment expenses for the uninsured, including testing. Details about this program are available [here](https://www.hrsa.gov/coviduninsuredclaim/frequently-asked-questions/). There is no requirement that clinics or physicians avail themselves of this program. As a result, it is possible that the uninsured could still be charged for testing by their healthcare provider.\\n\\n**Why is there so much confusion about pricing and payment for COVID-19 tests?**\\n\\nEarly on in the pandemic, in March, several faculty members at Johns Hopkins \u2013 myself included \u2013 recommended a very [different approach to the piecemeal strategy adopted by the federal government](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/03/19/pass-coronavirus-crisis-insurance-use-medicare-networks-billing-column/2865457001/). The idea would be to build a crisis insurance system centered on paying to test for and treat COVID-19, and to use the existing Medicare infrastructure and network to provide a payment system for all providers. Since the scale of the problem is national, a federal program would have the capacity to negotiate prices on a global scale, which would help reduce costs. It would also provide an easy route for billing among the large influx of requests for tests and materials that are inundating labs, emergency departments, and hospitals. Additionally, centralizing the expenses from coronavirus care under a crisis insurance program would greatly improve our data collection efforts as we continue to track the virus. Such an alternative path would have prevented many of the current frustrations with accessing and paying for diagnosis and care.\\n\\n","legacyIsNew":null,"isDrafted":null,"order":null,"date":"","attachments":[],"verticals":[],"authors":[]},{"id":8,"slug":"can-the-us-safety-net-handle-the-covid-19-pandemic-and-recession","meta":{"path":"/from-our-experts/can-the-us-safety-net-handle-the-covid-19-pandemic-and-recession","title":"Can the U.S. Safety Net Handle the COVID-19 Pandemic and Recession?","description":"Johns Hopkins economist Robert A.

Moffitt,* Department of Economics, Johns Hopkins University*\\n","content":"The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown the U.S. economy into a nosedive of unprecedented rapidity. **Millions of workers have lost their jobs and are unable to work from home**. GDP is plummeting, small business owners cannot meet their rent and other economic obligations, and loan payments in general are not being met, reducing bank income. Families are struggling to meet basic needs and are drawing down what little savings they have to meet those needs.\\n\\n**The U.S. has a social safety net that is supposed to provide assistance to families in need. How well is it working so far? Is it likely to adequately assist families in need in this historic crisis?** As has been reported in the media and has been discussed by Johns Hopkins\u2019 [DeLuca, Papageorge, and Kalish](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/from-our-experts/the-unequal-cost-of-social-distancing), the impact of the pandemic, social distancing, isolating in homes, and other emergency measures are likely to have a disproportionate impact on our neediest citizens and on minority groups. It would be extremely unfortunate if that disproportionate impact were reinforced by an inadequate response of our safety net programs to the needs of those families.\\n\\n**The answer to the question, as is so often the case, is both yes and no. On the one hand, the size and generosity of the nation\u2019s safety net programs have grown dramatically over the last several decades**, and today those programs deliver more total assistance than ever before. The capacity of the system to provide hundreds of millions of dollars of assistance is there. **On the other hand, the U.S. safety net system is not really a \u201csystem\u201d at all. It is a patchwork of different programs created at different times for different needs, and a long-standing criticism of the system is that many individuals fall through the cracks and do not receive adequate coverage.** These gaps will become glaringly obvious during this crisis. In addition, another important trend in many of the U.S. programs over the last three decades is that they have increasingly funneled more assistance to workers, and less assistance to people who aren\u2019t working. While that may work well when the economy is at full employment and jobs are plentiful, it doesn\u2019t work so well when jobs disappear. That problem is also becoming obvious during this crisis.\\n\\nTo understand these issues, it is necessary to discuss individual programs in the U.S. safety net \u201csystem\u201d. **Let us take three of the biggest and most important: the Unemployment Insurance (UI) program, the Food Stamp program, and the Medicaid program.**\\n\\nThe UI program is the nation\u2019s most important program to assist those who have become involuntarily unemployed and has always provided critical cash assistance in recessions and downturns. The program is obviously critical in the current rapid downturn, with unemployment skyrocketing by 22 million in a few short weeks and with a new 5 million unemployed applying for benefits, with both numbers surely to increase. On average, benefits \u201creplace\u201d about 50% of the paycheck that an unemployed person was being paid before they were laid off. While 50% is not 100%, getting half your paycheck is very important because it will allow families to eat and maybe to pay at least some if not all of the rent or the mortgage if it is not too much.\\n\\n**But researchers and policy analysts who follow the UI program know that it has experienced important deterioration in the last decade** because of the Achilles Heel of so many American welfare programs \u2013 they are entirely financed by states, and states differ both in their ability to pay benefits and in their desire to do so in the first place. Over the last ten years, dozens of states, not wanting to raise taxes to pay for benefits, have been tightening up eligibility criteria to cut costs. **As a result, today only about one-third of the unemployed get UI benefits, and that number has been falling over time.** In addition, for the same financial reasons, many states have been reducing benefit levels and cutting the number of weeks an unemployed person can receive benefits before they run out. The standard length of time a person used to be able to receive benefits was 26 weeks \u2013 half a year. But some states are now offering only 13 weeks of benefits. That is unlikely to be adequate in the current environment.\\n\\nThe CARES Act passed recently by Congress offered to pay for an extra 13 weeks of benefits, on top of whatever the state chooses to provide. The Act also importantly covered many part-time workers who were not previously eligible as well as many self-employed and gig workers, who are also not traditionally covered by the UI program. But the extra 13 weeks is unlikely to be adequate in those states which currently offer only 13 weeks of benefits.\\n\\n**What about the nation\u2019s Food Stamp program? Even middle class families are struggling with providing sufficient food for themselves because of social distancing, home isolation, and disruptions to the nation\u2019s food supply chain.** Low income families are struggling even more. The Food Stamp program \u2013 whose official name is the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program \u2013 will provide a lifeline to those low income families. The favorable nature of the program is that everyone with income below certain levels is covered, and it doesn\u2019t matter if the family has children or not, married or single, old or young. Everyone with low income is eligible. A family of 4 can get a maximum of $649 per month, for example. And, unlike the UI program, the Food Stamp program is entirely federal and the federal government is required, by law, to pay benefits to anyone who is eligible, no matter what the cost.\\n\\nBut the program has many eligibility requirements that will hinder its response to a sudden drop in income for a family. For example, federal rules are that a family can have no more than about $2,000 in the bank to be eligible (although states have the authority to raise that limit). That\u2019s fine for a person who has been poor all their lifetime, who probably has nothing in the bank and maybe not even a bank account, but a thrifty working family who has saved up some money in the bank while working won\u2019t be able to get assistance until they use up all that money they have saved. They would have to impoverish themselves. **The program is not designed to assist families who are not desperately poor and have only a temporary need for assistance.** Another problem is that Congress has imposed severe work requirements on many recipients, requiring them to find a job on their own before receiving much benefits. That obviously makes no sense in the current environment. Fortunately, the CARES Act recently passed by Congress temporarily suspended them, but only temporarily.\\n\\n**However, a major immediate problem is that the program is groaning under the weight of millions of new applications.** All the Food Stamp offices are closed and all applications are being handled online or by telephone. Processing times for applications have dropped dramatically and, in some states, applicants are being told that it will take at least 4 weeks before their applications can be processed. That is a long time to go without having adequate food. And the problem is made worse by the program\u2019s legitimate interest in ensuring that every applicant who is approved is truly \u201cdeserving.\u201d That means getting the applicant to provide paystubs from past jobs, bank statements with account balances, and documentation of any earnings from every person in the family. While this is reasonable during normal times, it is a major barrier when the applicants have to obtain all that information during a shutdown.\\n\\n**Because of the major delays in applications, low income and even middle-class families do not have enough food. They are swamping the local food banks, pantries, soup kitchens, and other local, non-profit organizations that ordinarily provide backup to families with short-term emergency food needs. Those organization do not have much money and are struggling to handle the avalanche of families coming in for food.**\\n\\n**Finally, the Medicaid program is the largest and fastest growing social safety net program of all.** The Affordable Care Act, passed by Congress and signed by the President in 2010, expanded benefits and coverage for millions of low-income families, who are now covered after they lose their jobs when they were not before. But the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that states did not, in fact, have to offer coverage to single individuals and married couples without children, even though the Act was interpreted as requiring states to provide that coverage. Subsequently, **15 states have decided that they are not going to cover those types of families and individuals, and those families and individuals therefore are losing coverage as they lose their jobs.** They will therefore have to go without health insurance during a major health crisis. Most of these families will, in all likelihood, have to go to the emergency room and get charity care if they need it, not only for virus treatment but for ordinary treatment. Once again, the \u201csafety net\u201d in the nation clearly has yet more holes that people drop through.\\n\\n**A final, more over-reaching problem with the U.S. safety net is that, over the last 30 years, assistance to the nation\u2019s poor has become more and more work-oriented.** Most of the leading programs now either have work requirements or some version of them, requiring recipients to find jobs in order to receive benefits. As a result, the average assistance going to nonworking families has declined over time. In addition, Congress has, over the decades, gradually increased benefits that go to working families. Today, if a family makes $20,000, they can get up to four thousand dollars in tax credits and thousands of dollars in work-based child care subsidies. **Researchers call this \u201cnew\u201d system in the U.S. the \u201cwork-based safety net\u201d. The only problem with it is that if a family isn\u2019t working, they get almost nothing.** They receive none of those tax credits and child care subsidies. If they are childless, they do not receive Medicaid if they live in one of the states that does give benefits to nonworkers without children. They cannot get benefits from a program that has maintained its work requirements during this Recession, as some programs have done. They will receive Unemployment Insurance for a few weeks, but only if they are lucky to be one of the 1/3 of the unemployed who is now eligible. The only benefit they will definitely get is Food Stamps, at least a few weeks after application. But families cannot live on food alone. The program does not pay the rent, it does not pay for children\u2019s school supplies, and it doesn\u2019t pay for gas, bus fare, or repairs to your furnace if it breaks down.\\n\\n**The glaring deficiencies in America\u2019s safety net system are being terribly revealed at this unfortunate time. Let us hope that the states and Congress will step up immediately to provide more emergency relief and, further, that those deficiencies will be addressed when the government returns to normal functioning and realizes that reforms are desperately needed.**","legacyIsNew":null,"isDrafted":null,"order":null,"date":"","attachments":[],"verticals":["testing"],"authors":[]},{"id":17,"slug":"the-covid-19-pandemic-and-health-disparities-among-children-a-q-and-a-with-dr-rachel-johnson-thornton","meta":{"path":"/from-our-experts/the-covid-19-pandemic-and-health-disparities-among-children-a-q-and-a-with-dr-rachel-johnson-thornton","title":"Q&A: The COVID-19 pandemic and health disparities among children","description":"Dr. Rachel J.

Thornton, associate professor of pediatrics at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, on how the coronavirus pandemic is affecting children and worsening health disparities throughout the United States.","content":"As the coronavirus pandemic stretches into the fall, COVID-19 raises particular challenges for children. For groups of children already experiencing health disparities, the effects of the virus have been particularly severe. To understand how the coronavirus pandemic is affecting children and worsening health disparities throughout the United States, we turned to Dr. Rachel J. Thornton, Associate Professor of Pediatrics at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.\\n\\n*What are health disparities?*\\n\\nHealth equity is achieved when everyone has a just and fair opportunity to be as healthy as possible. We measure society\u2019s progress towards achieving health equity by tracking meaningful differences in health status that are indicative of the ongoing health effects of injustice or disadvantage for certain groups in our society. Termed health disparities, these meaningful differences in health are the measure or metrics we use to quantify the progress or lack of progress toward achieving health equity. Health professionals use these metrics to shine a light on these meaningful or unjust differences in health outcomes that adversely affect marginalized groups.\\n\\n*How do health disparities vary between adults and children?*\\n\\nIn general, patterns of health disparities are durable across the lifespan. We see acute disparities in children across health conditions including asthma and obesity that are often based on racial/ethnic and socioeconomic status. In general, the patterns of disparate health outcomes in marginalized groups of children are similar to the patterns we see with adults \u2013 across a variety of conditions. \\n\\nBut one concern for children, especially, are vaccination rates. During the pandemic, there have been significant reductions, according to CDC data, in vaccination rates among children eligible for Medicaid \u2013 that\u2019s a disparate health impact. \\n\\n*How are health disparities influencing the pandemic\u2019s impact on children?*\\n\\nWe\u2019ve seen a lot already and we need to think broadly about not just infections from COVID-19, but also about how our responses to COVID-19 are disparately impacting different groups. For instance, what are the impacts of a move from in-person to online schooling or reducing access to public benefits such as food stamps, energy assistance or unemployment benefits? What is the impact of substantial reductions in the economic viability of non-essential businesses on children and their families? These policies have the potential to disproportionately affect vulnerable families\u2019 abilities to meet their children\u2019s needs. And the impacts are distributed in inequitable ways throughout our society, where people who have more resources are less likely to experience severe hardship from physical distancing measures or lockdowns. For others, these measures could intensify food or housing insecurity, especially with regards to closing schools and limiting the meals they traditionally provide to food insecure children.\\n\\nThere have been a lot of discussions among pediatricians and educators about access to education during the pandemic. There\u2019s the well-established, existing phenomenon documenting disparate learning loss for low-income and racial-ethnic minority children during the summer time (i.e., \u201csummer slide\u201d), and many are rightly concerned that we\u2019ll see these gaps exacerbated between advantaged and disadvantaged children due to the pandemic. This could also worsen due to inequitable access to technology, which can complicate a child\u2019s ability to take advantage of remote learning. The reason this is a health issue is because educational attainment is a strong indicator of socio-economic status later in life and can have significant impacts on one\u2019s health and financial wellbeing as an adult. \\n\\nAnother concern directly tied to the closing of schools is child nutrition. For food insecure children, the shutdown has made it hard to weigh the appropriateness and feasibility of closing schools for a certain period of time. For families that rely on school nutrition programs for free or reduced price meals for their children, the closures have made them considerably more vulnerable to poor nutrition and hunger than they were before. One positive response to school closure was an added, one-time EBT \u2013 or food stamps \u2013 benefit in the federal CARES Act. This benefit was to offset the cost of these meals for families in districts that were eligible for a free and reduced lunch. I saw the look on parents\u2019 faces when they learned about the extra benefit \u2013 they were thinking about how to stretch that money as much as possible. It\u2019s clear this made a difference, but it wasn\u2019t enough.\\n\\nThere are also ongoing concerns about school closures leading to a rise in child maltreatment, as schools are places where teachers and aides are trained to keep an eye on how students are doing physically and emotionally and are required to report cases of suspected abuse. There are ongoing concerns about disparities tied to mental health and trauma from the pandemic, but it\u2019s too early to say what the long-term impact of these factors on child health and equity will be.\\n\\n*Why might these disparities be occurring among different demographic groups of children?* \\n\\nIn truth, I\u2019m not sure the patterns of disparities we\u2019re seeing now are that much different from disparities before COVID, but the pandemic is intensifying them and bringing them to the fore of public consciousness. Across the board, being a member of a marginalized group or low-income population carries risks for child health, and the full impact of COVID-19 on the health and well-being of the most vulnerable children will continue to emerge over time. Before the pandemic, in 2019, the National Academy of Sciences issued a report that identified poverty as a fundamental cause of poor health for children in the U.S. We also know that racism is a fundamental threat to child health that the American Academy of Pediatrics statement released in 2019 laid bare. Thus, there are several forces at play during the pandemic that continue to put certain groups of children at greatest risk of harm and poor health. As an example, our inability to return safely to normal day-to-day life is disproportionately affecting families and children that were already disadvantaged economically. \\n\\nOn top of that, even before the pandemic close to 20% of children in the U.S. were poor, and their parents tend to have jobs that cannot accommodate working from home. This creates myriad challenges for low-income working parents. When they go into work, they are more likely to be exposed to the virus, which intersects with other disparities such as limited access to affordable childcare when schools are closed, limited access to broadband or technology for virtual learning, food insecurity, housing insecurity, and limited access to transportation. Together these conditions intersect such that Black, immigrant, and indigenous children are negatively impacted by both the virus and the consequences of the economic shut down in their communities. \\n\\nThese repercussions from poverty have also expanded to near-poor families that potentially had just enough resources before the pandemic to avoid food insecurity or housing insecurity but are now in dire straits from the adverse economic effects that continue in the face of the ongoing pandemic. Relief initiatives have largely not met the urgent need for housing, economic aid and healthcare during this pandemic. The inaction has consequences for increased disease transmission, but even bigger than that, the financial impacts of the pandemic are having outsized, disparately negative impacts on the health of those who were already vulnerable and struggling before COVID-19. \\n\\n*How can communities address COVID-related disparities for children?*\\n\\nThere are a lot of ways for communities to respond. Something I always try to emphasize in my work is that pediatricians have a key role to play as a resource and support for families. In many instances, medical providers and other community workers are aware of available resources like food banks, energy assistance or nutritional assistance, so I would encourage families in these positions to let their medical professionals know and to ask for assistance and not hold it as a source of shame. \\n\\nOn the community level, we need to avoid scenarios where vulnerable families are getting evicted or where they feel they have no choice but to continue to go to work despite concerns about symptoms of, or exposure to, the virus. I think communities have a role in raising up voices of compassion and advocating for compassionate policies from their governments to those in need due to the pandemic and the unprecedented economic hardship it has inflicted. That might mean letting local, state or federal lawmakers know about needs for housing security or adequate nutrition in your community. This includes things like advocating for programs to prevent worsening homelessness, evictions or hunger in your community and expressing your beliefs about the resources communities need during the pandemic to be able to care for all members in need. By ensuring stable housing and access to material resources, communities can begin to address the disparate outcomes that will linger long after COVID-19. That\u2019s how communities can give voice and help people facing dire straits through no fault of their own. There\u2019s a lot of pain and concern, especially in communities that feel they don\u2019t have a strong voice or platform, and we need to encourage them to make their voices heard by the people who represent them. This includes ensuring the parents and caregivers of children are encouraged to vote and to be counted in the Census and to have their voices heard. It\u2019s about ensuring that families can do the very best by their children and that, during this crisis, everyone has the resources to make that happen.

However, contact tracers in several areas of the country have been stymied by low response rates and mistrust from the community. \\n\\nTo understand the importance of contact tracing in combating the ongoing spread of COVID-19 and what people can expect if they receive a call from a contact tracer, the Hub reached out to Jonathan Zenilman, professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins Medicine to learn more.\\n\\n**Why would someone receive a call from a contact tracer?**\\n\\nYou would receive a call if you were identified as having been in close contact with somebody who has COVID-19. The idea is that when you have an infectious disease, there is something called the \u201cinfectious period,\u201d which is the length of time someone is contagious. For most diseases, this is a limited period of time that\u2019s well known. When someone has the infectious disease that you\u2019re tracing, you go back to the time when they first became infected, and then estimate the moment they became infectious and were able to transmit the disease to others. \\n\\nFor COVID-19, people become symptomatic on average after five days, but the infectious period begins two days before that and can continue for a week to ten days afterwards. The goal of a contact tracer is to identify all the individuals that they had close contact with during that period \u2013 for COVID-19, it\u2019s currently defined as anyone within 6 feet or having household contact. For other diseases, like tuberculosis, which is similar to COVID-19 in many respects, the infectious period is months long, so the period can vary quite a lot.\\n\\n**What happens when an individual receives a call from a contact tracer?**\\n\\nIf I had COVID-19, for example, a contact tracer would ask me to identify everyone I\u2019ve been physically close to in the past week. They might contact my wife, my neighbors, or anyone else I\u2019ve been in physical proximity to. The contact tracer would then reach out to those people and introduce themselves and their affiliation, which is usually a local health department. They\u2019ll verify your identity and information, and then they\u2019ll inform you that you\u2019ve been identified as having been in contact with someone who has COVID-19. \\n\\nAfter identifying these contacts, the contract tracer reaches out to the next round of contacts and the process essentially repeats itself. The steps for individuals to take, then, varies depending on the disease, typically depending on whether there is available therapy. For an STD or TB, contact tracing means being tested and receiving treatment. For COVID-19, hearing from a contact tracer would result in testing and a quarantine period.\\n\\n**What type of information will a contact tracer request?**\\n\\nThe information they\u2019ll ask for \u2013 and each local situation will be different \u2013 will be if you have any symptoms related to COVID-19, if you\u2019ve been tested for COVID-19, if you have underlying conditions that can make you more susceptible to the disease (like immunosuppression, hypertension, or diabetes) and they\u2019ll often recommend or arrange for you to get tested. They\u2019ll likely recommend that you quarantine in your house for a set period of time that adds up to fourteen days since the time of exposure.\\n\\n**What happens to the information a contact tracer collects?**\\n\\nWhile the information is not anonymous, it is confidential. This includes the source contact as well. If you ask the contact tracer, they will not be able to provide the name or any information about the source contact for reasons of confidentiality. Sometimes the source contact can be apparent, however, such as a spouse or a household member. All of this information is maintained within the health department, usually at the county or city level, but in some cases it could also be at the state level. This information is not given to anybody like an employer, insurer, or other individuals. If you are confirmed as a case of COVID-19 due to contact tracing, you will then be interviewed by the contact tracer and the cycle will continue.\\n\\n**Is information collected through contact tracing truly secure?**\\n\\nI think this is connected to a bigger anxiety and concern we are struggling with over the internet, data, and privacy. It\u2019s important for people to understand that this is one of the few tools we currently have to actually fight COVID-19. Information provided to contact tracers is one of the most secure kinds of health information that there is. Consider that people have been doing contact tracing for STDs like HIV for many decades and that information has been securely held that entire time \u2013 it never appears in newspapers, on the news, or on the internet.\\n\\nAny data that appears in public (such as case numbers) are never associated with personal identifiers. At its most specific, it might be reported at the zip code level by age, race, or gender, to aid epidemiologists in their work, but there are specific rules in place to protect the identity of the individuals. The health department will almost never release this information unless it\u2019s under extraordinary, highly unlikely, and tightly regulated proceedings like a court order.","legacyIsNew":null,"isDrafted":null,"order":null,"date":"","attachments":[],"verticals":[],"authors":[]},{"id":18,"slug":"how-should-we-talk-about-covid-19-a-q-and-a-with-uttara-bharath-kumar","meta":{"path":"/from-our-experts/how-should-we-talk-about-covid-19-a-q-and-a-with-uttara-bharath-kumar","title":"Q&A: How should we talk about COVID-19?","description":"Uttara Bharath Kumar, senior technical advisor for social and behavior change at the Johns Hopkins Center for Communication Programs, on the role of effective communication in stopping the spread of the novel coronavirus.","image":""},"section":"","title":"How should we talk about COVID-19? A Q&A with Uttara Bharath Kumar ","subtitle":null,"caption":"Uttara Bharath Kumar, senior technical advisor for social and behavior change at the Johns Hopkins Center for Communication Programs, on the role of effective communication in stopping the spread of the novel coronavirus.","content":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, effective messaging and communication have been powerful resources to combat the virus. Effective communication encourages the positive behaviors essential to limiting spread of the virus, but many communication efforts have been marred by shifting guidelines and mixed messaging. To better understand the role of effective communication in stopping the spread of the novel coronavirus, we reached out to Uttara Bharath Kumar, Senior Technical Advisor for Social and Behavior Change at the Johns Hopkins Center for Communication Programs, home to the [COVID-19 Communication Network](https://covid19communicationnetwork.org/compass-for-sbc/).\\n\\n*What lessons can the general public learn about effective ways of talking about COVID-19?*\\n\\nFor anyone trying to communicate effectively, it\u2019s important to communicate strategically. Being a strategic communicator means tailoring each message and its information to the needs of the people or audience hearing it. This means really taking the time to understand and empathize with your audience, even if you may not agree with them. Not everyone will need the same type of messaging around a subject, particularly one that has become as polarizing as the coronavirus. For example, the reasons someone might not have the knowledge to take preventative measures against the virus, compared to those who refuse to because they don\u2019t believe the virus is a real threat, are different, so each would need to receive customized messages. This understanding of audience-specific, individual and social barriers is really important, and our work at CCP puts great emphasis on that. Generally, messaging around COVID-19 has tended towards one size fits all, across the board. \\n\\nThe pandemic has also asked the population for a big change in behavior over a short timeline. It has caused people to change their way of life very quickly by broadly limiting economic and leisure activities. For other diseases, we\u2019ve only tasked select groups with avoiding certain environmental risks or risky behaviors. Now we\u2019re asking everyone to make those changes, and keeping the scale of that ask in mind is helpful in communicating it.\\n\\nAnd, interestingly, our behavior is the most powerful treatment we have until there is a vaccine. If we had a high level of compliance with preventative measures, we could potentially turn the outbreak around. We see this clearly even within the United States: in the states with more masking and distancing and delayed re-openings to public places, the virus has been reduced in a much more effective way than in states with mixed messaging and shifting policies. That\u2019s why communication is so important during this pandemic: until enough of our population has received a vaccine, our behavior has a bigger role to play than medical science.\\n\\n*How have uncertainties about COVID-19 impacted communication related to the pandemic?*\\n\\nIt has been particularly challenging to communicate around the coronavirus because there are a few aspects to this crisis that are unique. One unusual aspect is how little we knew about the virus at the start of the outbreak. Our responses to the virus haven\u2019t required entirely new behaviors \u2013 activities like washing hands or keeping distance from someone with the virus are already well established \u2013 but since this virus is much more dangerous than the regular flu, convincing people about its severity has been a challenge. \\n\\nAnother unique aspect of this virus has been the constant drip of new information, and the ongoing evolution of new precautions for individuals to take. The best example is the variability in mask wearing policies: at first, the policy was that only sick people and healthcare workers should wear them, but now it\u2019s recommended for everyone. This evolution of information has made messaging very challenging, as it has made some people doubt experts and scientific institutions. That\u2019s why it\u2019s really important for leaders to build trust with their communities, to emphasize that they have their best interests in mind and to communicate new information as it comes forward. This includes acknowledging where they were wrong before because that was the best available information at that time. \\n\\n*How can people navigate many of the challenging emotions that come with talking about COVID-19? *\\n\\nIt\u2019s true, there are a lot of emotions that have become tied up with COVID-19, and this virus has not been a fair or equal opportunity offender. Social, educational and economic disparities have mattered \u2013 not everyone has the same access to information, resources and support. Consider returning to work \u2013\xa0it\u2019s a choice for some and not for others. Similarly, keeping physical distance may not be easy when families live in crowded conditions and some of them have to take public transport, go to work and face exposure. \\n\\nIn this case, you want to make sure people don\u2019t feel fearful or helpless but instead feel empowered to do small but important actions. Self-efficacy \u2013 the feeling that, \u201cI\u2019m responsible for me and I can do this!\u201d \u2013 is critical. It\u2019s the understanding that, if each one of us does what we can, we can protect our community. So, you can empower people by telling them that, \u201cif you have to go back to work, this is what you need to do to stay safe.\u201d But there\u2019s also a balance between empowerment and making people feel overly confident about the situation. You also want to maintain a high level of vigilance and awareness, while making others empowered to overcome the threat of the virus in their specific scenario.\\n\\nThe biggest issue in all of this is that people tend to make up communication strategy as they go along. But, there\u2019s a wealth of information that\u2019s been carefully researched and developed, including a host of tools and resources about encouraging positive behavior that people can adapt and use. As in the world of advertising, people are unlikely to practice a particular behavior \u2013 even for public health \u2013 unless they see what\u2019s in it for them. If we can make it clear how these behaviors help them and people they care about, then it\u2019ll be easier to help individuals make these changes and keep our communities safe.\\n\\n*How should parents talk with their children about returning to school and COVID-19?*\\n\\nThis is an area where many organizations have struggled to come up with best practices. \\n\\nWhen communicating with children around COVID-19, we recommend acknowledging their anxieties and concerns. Part of this is balancing openness and transparency without tilting into doom and gloom. You want to empower them to continue preventative behaviors like wearing a mask and washing their hands, which will help keep everyone safe and also make school and seeing friends possible. If children are returning to school or if they are remote, it\u2019s helpful to discuss the differences that they will experience if the school has made those differences clear already. Going over changed protocols and expectations can help ease the transition. Overall, with children the goal is to stay upbeat and highlight positives whenever possible while also communicating openly and explaining why certain steps are taking place. \\n\\nUncertainty can be harder for children than the disappointment of, say, not being able to attend school. Also, parents can work closely with schools and educational institutions to unite around one or two messages to maintain consistency to the extent possible. \\n\\nWe have a number of resources at the [COVID-19 Communication Network](https://covid19communicationnetwork.org/), which includes a library of curated materials and resources, some of them focused on communicating with children.\\n\\n*How can one talk with friends or family members who may doubt the science behind the coronavirus?*\\n\\nThe most important thing is to remember that simple, clear messaging is a strength here. In this case, complexity can detract from the messaging goal. You also want to acknowledge that they have a different point of view. Instead of telling them they\u2019re wrong, you might try to find compelling information that may offer them another point of view, and present it to them in a nonthreatening way. This might be straightforward messaging that highlights one or two key elements and shows simple evidence \u2013 like how hard it is to blow out a candle while wearing a mask, which shows how a mask can limit exhaled particles that spread the virus. \\n\\nBe sure also to tailor your communications to the needs of the listener. Some might need data and scientific articles to be convinced of a certain aspect. For others, the questioning is tied to rights-based issues \u2013 they want the liberty to not wear a mask \u2013 and messaging in that case might focus on the role of the public good in wearing a mask to help others. When people feel they are being confronted, they tend to dig in their heels deeper and not open their minds to other points of view, but by tailoring our communication to the audience we\u2019re talking to, and looking at their individual barriers or sticking points, we can still effectively communicate about the pandemic.\\n\\n*What are best practices for business and community leaders when communicating with their employees and constituents about returning to work?*\\n\\nLeaders should check available materials and tools from leading experts, like the CDC, the WHO, Johns Hopkins, and other credible sources, and adapt those resources to their specific context. \\n\\nOur [website](https://covid19communicationnetwork.org/) also includes the [Synthesized Guidance to COVID-19 Messaging](https://synthesized.covid19communicationnetwork.org/home) (in English and French) that incorporates latest global guidance from the WHO, CDC, and other credible sources in very simple language designed to be understood by a general audience. There are sections on returning to work for different industries, including on communicating with health workers, and messaging for health workers to use with their clients. It\u2019s key to also make sure you have the latest information as the information is changing quickly \u2013 staying up to date and using simple, doable actions is the best way to empower community members and employees. Too much information can be overwhelming.\\n\\nFor workplace safety, establishing positive social norms can help nudge people toward adopting these preventative behaviors that are essential to workplace safety. One way to establish these positive social norms is to have models that the audience can relate to \u2013 showing people from the targeted community wearing masks can make others more inclined to do it. Part of this is about stressing a mutual responsibility in order to keep everyone safe and for workplaces and community spaces to continue functioning.\\n\\n","legacyIsNew":null,"isDrafted":null,"order":null,"date":"","attachments":[],"verticals":[],"authors":[]},{"id":16,"slug":"q-and-a-understanding-covid-19-as-an-airborne-disease","meta":{"path":"/from-our-experts/q-and-a-understanding-covid-19-as-an-airborne-disease","title":"Q&A: Understanding COVID-19 as an airborne disease","description":"Associate Professor Kirsten Koehler and Assistant Professor Ana Rule, both of the Department of Environmental Health and Engineering at the Bloomberg School of Public Health, on aerosolization and how it may be contributing to the spread of COVID-19.","image":""},"section":"","title":"Q&A: Understanding COVID-19 as an airborne disease","subtitle":null,"caption":"Associate Professor Kirsten Koehler and Assistant Professor Ana Rule, both of the Department of Environmental Health and Engineering at the Bloomberg School of Public Health, on aerosolization and how it may be contributing to the spread of COVID-19.","content":"In early July, the World Health Organization (WHO) revised its guidelines to state that the novel coronavirus is airborne, meaning that the virus can pass from person to person through the air. This phenomenon, known as aerosolization, adds to our evolving knowledge of how the virus continues to spread. To understand more about aerosolization, and how it may be contributing to the spread of COVID-19, we spoke with Associate Professor Kirsten Koehler and Assistant Professor Ana Rule, both of the Department of Environmental Health and Engineering at the Bloomberg School of Public Health.\\n\\n\\n**What is aerosolization and what does it mean for spread of infectious diseases?**\\n\\n**Koehler:** Anytime we speak, cough, or sneeze, we emit a wide range of particles of different sizes. These include large particles, which we call droplets, and small particles we call aerosols. As an aerosol scientist, I see it as a continuum: droplets are usually considered to be larger than 5 microns and fall quickly to the ground, usually in less than 45 minutes. Smaller particles \u2013 aerosols \u2013 have such little mass that they\u2019re not affected by gravity. These particles hang in the air for longer periods of time. Indoors, these smaller particles can circulate in a room and move with airflow from a ventilation system so that they quickly spread and mix throughout an enclosed space. If someone in the room is carrying a respiratory infectious disease, this poses a potential route of exposure for anyone else breathing that same air. This happens for all airborne infectious diseases. What we don\u2019t know are the proportions: how much of the virus is in these big and small particles, and what proportion of people who become infected are getting infected from touching surfaces versus droplets versus aerosols.\\n\\n**Is the novel coronavirus airborne?**\\n\\n**Rule:** Yes. I would describe it as such. We can see this in all the evidence and the studies we have thus far, and even in the very first laboratory experiments that aerosolized the virus and measured the virus\u2019s viability over time. Those early lab studies found that it was definitely possible for the virus to survive aerosolized. More and more studies have since found aerosols of the virus in real world scenarios \u2013 particularly in hospital rooms and hallways, even though hospitals have strong ventilation and filtration systems. If you can find it there, it increases the possibility that you\u2019ll find aerosolized virus in other places that aren\u2019t as well ventilated. \\n\\n**Can you tell if someone was infected through aerosols?**\\n\\n**Rule:** I don\u2019t think, for any infectious disease, we really know for sure the proportion of infections from aerosols versus surfaces versus droplets, but there are some diseases that are confirmed \u2013 like Ebola, measles, and now COVID-19 \u2013 to spread through aerosols. But, it\u2019s almost impossible to know for certain whether someone was infected by aerosols versus droplets or surfaces.\\n\\n**Koehler:** That\u2019s right. There\u2019s really no way to tell, but there are some clues. Take the [Washington Choir](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6919e6.htm) case. There was a compelling model done using that example to show how the novel coronavirus might circulate to infect so many people in a rehearsal room. The other part of this challenge is the wide range of variability in aerosol production. Different people and different activities can lead to higher levels of aerosol production. We don\u2019t know why some people produce more than others \u2013 and so narrowing the root cause of infection is much harder to do, as is apportioning how many people are getting infected through different exposures. \\n\\n**What are the implications for preventing transmission of Covid-19?**\\n\\n**Koehler:** We could see a stronger emphasis on the use of masks. Think of masks as a way to reduce the number of particles you emit. As we\u2019re emitting these particles that contain a lot of water, once they\u2019re in the air they evaporate and get smaller. If we can control how many particles are emitted at the source, from our mouths, it reduces the concentration of them, and the virus, in the air. Fabric masks are fairly effective at catching these bigger particles and are an especially appropriate measure when in an indoor space where ventilation is lower. We also need to encourage places to have the best ventilation that they can \u2013 this means opening doors and windows, using fans, and changing air filters to the best that your system allows. These steps can limit the virus from existing in the recycled air in a ventilation system.\\n\\n**Rule:** One thing about ventilation systems is that not all systems can handle the highest grade and efficiency filters. Some high-end, hospital-grade filters won\u2019t work well in a home ventilation system. So it\u2019s important to use the one that fits the highest grade for your system. If the filter efficiency is too high, it can make it so your system cannot pull air through the filter and you can actually decrease ventilation. The other measure that we\u2019re already taking \u2013 keeping six feet of distance \u2013 is even more important now. For particles in the air, distancing is still an effective tool.\\n\\n**Koehler:** Yes, keeping distance continues to be essential. We\u2019ve been talking about the importance of keeping six feet of distance because that\u2019s the general range for droplets, but another benefit of keeping distance is that, by taking those extra steps back, the particles that you\u2019re emitting or being exposed to become less concentrated. Giving more space lets the virus dilute in the air. At some point, the further you are from the source, the lower the risk of infection\u2013 it\u2019s true for both droplets and aerosols.\\n\\n**Are any of these steps substantially different from the safety measures that were already in place?**\\n\\n**Koehler:** I think a lot of people feel that there are constantly changing recommendations, but what we\u2019ve tried to emphasize is that, really, what we\u2019re doing is adding to the original recommendations. Measures like washing your hands, keeping distance, and staying home are all still essential, but as we learn more about the virus we need to adapt \u2013 like needing to wear masks as well.\\n\\n**Rule:** I should also mention that masks are effective at stopping some of those bigger droplets, but face shields are actually less protective than masks because they are open on the sides and at the bottom. A face shield can be paired with a mask, but it shouldn\u2019t replace a mask. Short of use as one element in a full set of hospital PPE, a face shield just hasn\u2019t proven effective. In a building like a school, the close quarters and closed environment would make face shields alone infective and prove a recipe for disaster. \\n\\n**Koehler:** Face shields do help prevent people from touching their faces, and it\u2019s really important to not touch your mask when you\u2019re outside and wearing it, but if you want to wear a face shield, pair it with a mask. \\n\\n**Rule:** I have a couple of different types of masks \u2013 you find the kind of mask that works for you, and the comfort will vary by person, but you really shouldn\u2019t be touching it when you\u2019re out in the world.\\n\\n**Why did the WHO change its position about aerosolization of Covid-19?**\\n\\n**Rule:** I don\u2019t think we know for sure, but a big part of it was the open letter signed by over 200 scientists that argued that even though we don\u2019t know definitively that it\u2019s airborne, it doesn\u2019t mean that the virus isn\u2019t. All the science we know today is signifying that we should consider Covid-19 airborne, even just as a precaution. \\n\\n**Koehler:** The thing is, if you\u2019re protecting people from aerosols, you\u2019re also protecting them from droplets, too. Being more proactive in this way really can\u2019t hurt.\\n","legacyIsNew":null,"isDrafted":null,"order":null,"date":"","attachments":[],"verticals":[],"authors":[]},{"id":28,"slug":"science-in-the-face-of-fear-commentary-on-vaccine-hesitancy","meta":{"path":"/vaccines/blog/science-in-the-face-of-fear-commentary-on-vaccine-hesitancy","title":"Science in the face of fear: a commentary on vaccine hesitancy and public trust","description":"COVID-19 VACCINE MATTERS: A blog series discussing the evolving science and policy of COVID-19 vaccines, led by internationally renowned experts in vaccine development, Dr. Larry Corey of the Univeristy of Washington, and Dr. Chris Beyrer of Johns Hopkins University.","image":"/images/assets/JHU-Blog-Brand-JHUUW-02_0c03ab0ec1.jpeg"},"section":"Vaccine Blogs","title":"Science in the face of fear: a commentary on vaccine hesitancy and public trust","subtitle":"","caption":"*The views and opinions expressed here are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the position of either Johns Hopkins University and Medicine or the University of Washington.*","content":"Key Points:  \\n- The efficacy of the Pfizer and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines is a scientific triumph with vast potential to save lives.  \\n- The political context within which the Covid-19 vaccines were developed has led to mistrust and hesitancy among some Americans, and it will take time to heal these wounds.  \\n- Regardless of politics, the scientific goal has always been the development of vaccines that can alter or stop Covid-19, and that goal has now been achieved.  \\n\\nThis month has been one of media whipsaw. Recent news of the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines\u2019 efficacy and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s rapid response and issuance of an Emergency Use Authorization for both vaccines have been met with equal parts jubilation and mistrust from a divided public.  \\n\\nFor me, as a medical virologist and researcher, this remarkable achievement is a clear demonstration of the power of science and its potential impact to save lives. To see these curves below that show the difference in disease course between those vaccinated and those receiving the saltwater placebo are about as big a spread as I\u2019ve ever seen in any study. We call these Kaplan-Meier curves, and if you\u2019ve worked in cancer or most diseases, you know that you just never get to see curves like these. And this is one reason I have embedded the curves of both studies  into this blog. If you are used to seeing these curves, they just make you smile and think, \u201cHow did that happen?\u201d \\n \\n#### Cumulative Incidence Curves of COVID-19 - Pfizer  \\n![Cumulative Incidence Curves of COVID-19 - Pfizer]()  \\n\\n#### Cumulative Incidence Curves of COVID-19 - Moderna  \\n![Cumulative Incidence Curves of COVID-19 - Moderna]()  \\n\\nA scientific success such as this one just feels good and with it comes a sense of community pride, particularly when you see the incredible adulation from impassioned medical care workers who are embracing receipt of the vaccines. It is incredibly rewarding to see videos of health care providers dancing outside of the hospitals; or simply images of front-line workers with their heads bent, overcome with relief and gratitude about how a vaccine has arrived that seems powerful enough to relieve them of the stress of doing their job.   \\n\\nAnd yet, how does one measure a successful outcome in its entirety when recent [polls](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/12/03/intent-to-get-a-covid-19-vaccine-rises-to-60-as-confidence-in-research-and-development-process-increases/) show that approximately 40% of Americans would be unlikely to get a vaccine even when it becomes available to them? Or when one reads about town hall meetings populated by fellow Americans who are clearly mistrustful, images with hesitant faces: the complex emotions are plain. \\nThese images and data force one to pause \u2013 to take a step back and view the difference in perspectives \u2013 because the two visions side by side are difficult to balance.  \\n\\nTrue, maybe most Americans haven\u2019t seen a Kaplan-Meier curve, maybe they don\u2019t understand the nuances of the clinical studies and their protocols, but they understand what 95% means \u2013 a clear indication that the vaccine helps. It helps a lot. But still, I have seen the fear firsthand: I have an acquaintance whose mother refuses to take the vaccine \u2013 someone above seventy years of age with multiple risk factors for severe COVID-19. This woman has sought my advice for other medical concerns. But in this situation, the fear overrides her knowledge of what science can (and does) accomplish. My first reaction is to talk to my acquaintance in an authoritative way, and then it occurred to me that I wasn\u2019t going to change her worldview simply because I was \u201cthe medical authority\u201d sharing the information.  \\n\\nSo, then I step back: how can I do this respectfully? Or how much energy should I put into this? How do we set our expectations? What\u2019s the goal here? I\u2019m reminded of one of those statements learned by most of us early on \u2013 probably while arguing with an authority figure who was trying to offer reason: you can lead a horse to water, but you can\u2019t make it drink. So, I think there are lessons to be learned on both sides \u2013 that we all need to be respectful of differing viewpoints while we move toward greater understanding, compassion, and trust. And we all need to understand that there is context \u2013 for each person.  \\n\\nThere are some situations \u2013 and the COVID-19 pandemic might be one of them \u2013 where the tincture of time is needed to heal the wounds. And there are wounds that have bred mistrust, some caused by self-serving narratives of national leadership that were unrelated to the scientific process at hand. And although the outgoing administration did a wonderful thing by providing an enormous amount of funding, \u201cOperation Warp Speed\u201d isn\u2019t a name that inspires trust. In most other contexts, and certainly outside of a public health emergency, when we think of the rigors of science, speed is not something we associate with positive outcomes. And throughout the vaccine trials, anytime something good happened, it was narcissistically claimed by the administration rather than letting the real inventors within the scientific process own it. By personalizing it, it became politicized. It created an odd discord, as if science \u2013 and what is in a vial \u2013 had something to do with whether you\u2019re a Republican or Democrat.  \\n\\nOf course, we didn\u2019t put Democrats in the vial; we didn\u2019t put Republicans in the vial. And, the scientific goal has always been this: how do we alter and stop the disease that is rapidly attacking our nation and its people? How do we use pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical interventions alike to control the spread and keep Americans safe? Scientifically the goal has always been the same. How different political leaders communicate varies. And the vial gets caught up in the middle.  \\n\\nI don\u2019t know how to unwind this except for time. I don\u2019t know how to unwind this except for understanding. At a young age, I was taught a wise saying by my brother-in-law who was my closest role model and the reason I became a physician. He died far too early \u2013 at age 37 \u2013 from Candida sepsis secondary to Hodgkin\'s disease therapy. He said to me, \u201cLarry, the educated man is the tolerant man.\u201d  \\n\\nIt will take work by all of us \u2013 in the scientific community and in the broader public. It will take hard work to convey the importance of vaccination. It will take time to rebuild trust across the divide. And it will take a public open to healing discourse; a public who remains curious and eager to know more as we learn more. Because we will.  \\n\\nIf this pandemic has taught us anything, it has taught us that scientific successes beyond imagining are possible with resources and the kind of global scientific collaboration we\u2019ve seen over the past ten months. And as a scientist and physician, I will take solace in knowing that those who want the vaccine, and can benefit from it, will be able to utilize the resource. I pray that all who want, not just in our country but globally, will be able to receive this gift of science. All the people of the world deserve to be vaccinated.

The last several weeks have brought sobering findings that have produced a large alteration in both the American and scientific psyche about COVID-19 vaccines, the trajectory of the epidemic, and the understanding that life can sometimes just be complicated. We first saw the Alpha variant, which was two times more infectious than the ancestral strain, followed by Beta, which was eight times more resistant in laboratory assays to neutralization, and which also reduced vaccine efficacy. And now Delta is here and just ripping through both of them, like a hot knife through butter, replacing Beta with the same rapidity that it replaced Alpha and all the in-between variants.  \\n\\nSo, what is it about this Delta, or what I should say, many Deltas? Because what we\u2019re seeing is this fascinating, scientific change in the virus that\u2019s happened at incredible rapidity. Delta has some new characteristics that make it a formidable foe. It\u2019s much more infectious to others; initial titers of the virus in the nose seem to be higher than previous strains with more rapid spread into the lungs and other organs within the body. It is clear that the amount of virus required to infect others is lower, making transmissibility to household and casual contacts more efficient than the other variants. Case numbers are quickly increasing, ICUs are filling up, and most disconcertingly, we are seeing more children being admitted in our pediatric hospitals. When we look at who\u2019s in the hospital among adults, we see an unprecedented number of people who have not been vaccinated \u2013 95 to 98 percent. The same pattern is seen with children. COVID-19 Delta strain is a hospital epidemic of the unvaccinated.  \\n\\nYes, we are now seeing outbreaks of Delta in which vaccinated people are infected. These outbreaks involve two behaviors that result in super-spreader events \u2013 crowding and indoor revelry with drinking and eating and no masks. Eating, drinking, shouting, singing \u2013 spraying forth, shall we say, produces a density of unseen viral particles in the air. These behaviors are the food of the virus \u2013 a heavy smorgasbord of food: all advantageous to the virus. The result is that we are seeing humans get infected. For the vaccinated, this means just mild infection. But for the unvaccinated, we are seeing rapid spread of the virus to the lungs and other parts of the body.  \\n\\nWe\u2019ve seen a necessary reintroduction of masking in our country and a return of anxiety to much of the populace. Will our children be able to safely go back to school? Can we safely go back to work? Will we ever be able to relax and enjoy dinner indoors again with friends, extended family, or in professional settings? Delta is disconcerting to all of us. Today, I cancelled a COVID-19 Prevention Network (CoVPN) scientific meeting scheduled for October \u2013 one that I\u2019d been eagerly planning and anticipating for months. We wanted to meet and celebrate/review the work the network has done. The success of the program and the hard work and toil have shaped professional careers dramatically, if not entire worldviews. We wanted to revel in the camaraderie of the team\u2019s success and do so in person. But it was clear \u2013 even though the event required vaccination to attend \u2013 no one wanted to come to Seattle to celebrate with the possible risk it would carry if anyone contracted Delta and had to be quarantined away from home.  \\n\\nLet\u2019s look at vaccination and Delta as it relates to the U.S.:  \\n\\n1. The mRNA and Janssen vaccines are highly effective against death and hospitalization (greater than 90 to 98%).  \\n2. The protection from getting symptomatic COVID-19 appears to be a bit less with the Delta variant \u2013 studies show a range from 85% to 40% \u2013 and this may differ by time post-vaccination. But in all studies the severity of illness is markedly less \u2013 the immune system of vaccinated persons can rapidly clear Delta. As noted above, severe disease among the vaccinated in the U.S. with the mRNA or Janssen vaccines is rare.  \\n3. Transmission to others from vaccinated persons can occur but it is less than from the unvaccinated population, although we have not yet demonstrated how much less.\\nSo, yes, one can still get infected with Delta despite being vaccinated if one doesn\u2019t use precautions. That\u2019s a fact. But a bigger fact is that you won\u2019t get very sick, and you can reduce the risk of acquiring COVID-19 and spreading it if you wear a mask.  \\n\\nPerhaps we shouldn\u2019t have been surprised. We understood that reducing acquisition of COVID-19 was a harder goal than ameliorating disease. But we do know the vaccines work and countless lives have been saved by them. So, the vaccines have markedly changed the dynamic of our thought process, but maybe what we need is to change our expectations.  \\n\\nWhat do I mean by that?  \\n\\nWell, the virus is teaching us another important lesson: it can adapt with amazing speed. It\u2019s hard to understand how a virus like this is rolling through the world. But rolling through it is. Recent data out of Israel estimates that every six to nine days the Delta infection among its population doubles. As Israel has the highest percent vaccination rate (with the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine) of any adult population in the world, this is at first glance surprising. However, it\u2019s less surprising when one recognizes that younger people are not yet vaccinated, and it\u2019s the unvaccinated that are the main fuel for that kind of speed.  \\n\\nWhy is it so transmissible? What selective pressure is it under? It doesn\u2019t have the obvious neutralization-resistant mutations. What part of the human immune response that you get from vaccination is being delayed by the Delta variant? Will boosters actually slow it down or is it really more important to focus our efforts on reaching the unvaccinated? These are all scientific questions needing answers. As Israel has made the decision to boost its elderly population, some data about the role that boosting can play in reducing disease spread will be obtained.  \\n\\nBut the boosting issue is a bit of a diversion from the main issue in our country, which is: how do we reduce the spread of this highly infectious variant?  \\n\\nDo we need a national mandate for vaccination? Is personal choice to vaccinate or not the defining moment here? Or is the defining moment that we all have a societal obligation to not be the fuel for the forest fire? The unvaccinated in some respects are an unsuspecting accomplice to the arsonist at large \u2013 they serve as bone-dry tinder for the lighted match. \\nShould we rethink this?  \\n\\nOur body politics are not allowing a universal approach to public health. Do our corporate leaders who can mandate vaccination step up to the plate? Does anyone really believe that the Emergency Use Authorization is that much different than the FDA licensing it under a full Biologics License Application? Does any argument saying that the FDA hasn\u2019t certified it bring out any sense of credulity? Yes, there are important steps to licensing the medication so that there is consistency from lot to lot in manufacturing. But at 400 million vaccinated and growing daily, we have ample safety and efficacy data.  \\n\\nSo, yes, official product licensure is, to this author, not an appropriate reason to hold back mandated vaccination. Each day the documentation of the positive effect of the vaccines grows, and we understand that the virus is continuing to mutate. So, decreasing the fuel options is really the only way to slow down the rate of mutational alterations.  \\n\\nIt is true that the Delta variant has swept in like a cold, damp morning shrouded by fog. And it\u2019s left us with a bit of a shiver. But like all days, morning turns to afternoon and the sun gets higher in the horizon and some of the fog lifts. Although Delta has taken us two steps back, a much more important step forward is to continue to vaccinate as many of our citizens as we can. Once we do, Delta may move itself two steps back, putting us once again two steps forward toward pre-COVID-19 normalcy.","legacyIsNew":true,"isDrafted":null,"order":0,"date":"08/16/21","attachments":[],"verticals":[],"authors":["larry-corey"]},{"id":19,"slug":"types-of-covid-19-vaccines","meta":{"path":"/vaccines/report/types-of-covid-19-vaccines","title":"A Primer on COVID-19 Vaccine Development, Allocation and Deployment","description":"This primer outlines key terms and concepts related to COVID-19 vaccines and is intended for members of the general public, policy makers, educators, and key stakeholders.","image":""},"section":"Vaccine Reports","title":"Types of COVID-19 Vaccines","subtitle":"","caption":"This primer outlines key terms and concepts related to COVID-19 vaccines and is intended for members of the general public, policy makers, educators, and key stakeholders.","content":"[International Vaccine Access Center](https://www.jhsph.edu/ivac/)\\n\\nThis primer on Covid-19 vaccines consists of a series of brief reports on vaccine development, allocation, and deployment in the United States and globally. The intended audience is the general public as well as policymakers, educators, and key stakeholders interested in a concise guide to Covid-19 vaccines. Topics to be addressed include ensuring the safety and efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines, principles for vaccine allocation, strategies for deployment and delivery of Covid-19 vaccines, vaccine confidence and demand, and the economics of Covid-19 vaccines.\\n\\n## Types of Covid-19 Vaccines\\n\\nSeveral different types of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease Covid-19, are in development. Some are based on traditional methods for producing vaccines and others use newer methods.\\n\\nVaccines stimulate the human body\u2019s own protective immune responses so that, if a person is infected with a pathogen, the immune system can quickly prevent the infection from spreading within the body and causing disease. In this way, vaccines mimic natural infection but without actually causing a person to become sick.\\n\\nFor SARS-CoV-2, antibodies that bind to and block the spike protein on the virus\u2019s surface are thought to be most important for protection from disease because the spike protein is what attaches to human cells, allowing the virus to enter. Blocking this entrance prevents infection and thus disease and transmission to others.\\n\\n## Desired vaccine characteristics\\n\\nThe ideal SARS-CoV-2 vaccine would:\\n\\n1. be safe and associated with only mild, transient side effects (e.g. soreness and low-grade fever);\\n2. confer long-lasting protection (more than a season) in a high proportion of vaccine recipients (e.g. >80%), particularly in vulnerable populations such as the older adults and those with other underlying medical conditions or risk factors such as obesity;\\n3. protect not only against disease but prevent virus transmission to others;\\n4. be administered as a single dose;\\n5. be able to be produced quickly and in large quantities; \\n6. be easily stored (e.g., not at ultra-low temperatures, in packaging that does not require a lot of space);\\n7. can be easily transported (e.g., outside of the cold-chain or even through the mail); and\\n8. can be easily administered (does not require special devices, self-administered or administered by those who do not require much training).\\n\\nThe initial SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will not have all of these characteristics and we may never have a vaccine that does. Different types of vaccines will have different characteristics with different tradeoffs. The most important characteristics are that a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine be safe, shortly after vaccination and in the long term, and protect a substantial proportion of those vaccinated against moderate to severe disease, particularly those in the most vulnerable groups.  \\n\\n## Inactivated virus vaccines\\n\\nSeveral inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been developed, including those by Sinovac Biotech, Sinopharm, the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products, and Bharat Biotech. Inactivation of viruses is a well-established method to produce vaccines and several inactivated virus vaccines are widely used, including vaccines against influenza, polio, hepatitis A, and rabies viruses. The virus is inactivated so that it can no longer replicate or multiply. The immune system is exposed to viral proteins but the inactivated virus cannot cause disease. The inactivated virus stimulates the body\u2019s immune system to produce antibodies so when a person is exposed to the natural virus, antibodies are called to action to fight the virus. \\n\\nProduction of inactivated virus vaccines requires the ability to cultivate or grow the virus in large quantities. Because viruses cannot replicate outside of host cells, vaccine viruses need to be cultured in continuous cell lines or tissues. Influenza virus, for example, is typically grown in eggs to produce the inactivated influenza vaccine. The virus is then purified and concentrated before inactivation with chemicals. Inactivated vaccines typically do not provide immune responses as strong as attenuated (i.e., modified or weakened viruses so they do not cause disease) viral vaccines and may require booster doses to achieve and sustain protection.\\n\\nInactivated virus vaccines have been produced for many decades and the manufacturing procedures are well established and relatively straightforward, although there are challenges to producing safe and effective inactivated virus vaccines. First, the inactivation process has to sufficiently inactivate all of the virus without changing viral proteins so much that they induce weak immune responses. Second, the inactivation process cannot alter the virial proteins in a way that results in an abnormal or altered immune response and enhanced disease after exposure to the natural virus. As with all vaccines, the immunogenicity of new inactivated virus vaccines must be rigorously tested to ensure safety and efficacy.\\n\\n## Protein-based vaccines\\n\\nMany vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 in development include only viral proteins and no genetic material, including those by Novavax, Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline, SpyBiotech, and others. Some use whole viral proteins and others just pieces of viral proteins. For SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, this means either the spike protein on the surface of the virus or a portion of the spike protein called the receptor-binding domain, which binds to host cells (i.e., the cells where viruses can replicate). These protein-based, or subunit, vaccines work much like inactivated vaccines by exposing the immune system to viral proteins and inducing protective immune responses without causing disease. In the case of protein-based vaccines, this is because no genes necessary for virus replication are included in the vaccine.\\n\\nProtein-based vaccines have been widely used and have a long history of safety and effectiveness. Examples include vaccines for hepatitis B virus, shingles, and the bacteria that cause whooping cough (pertussis). There are different ways of producing recombinant viral proteins, including production of the virus protein in yeast or insect cells. Protein-based vaccines also can be packaged in different ways and combined with vaccine adjuvants (additives in small quantities) that improve or enhance immune responses. The Novavax SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, for example, uses nanoparticles of cholesterol, phospholipid, and saponins from the soap bark tree to deliver viral proteins to cells of the immune system and stimulate strong immune responses.\\n\\nThe addition of adjuvants to vaccines is another common way of enhancing the immune responses to virus proteins. Protein-based vaccines sometimes do not induce strong CD8 T cell responses, the cells that destroy virus-infected cells, and adjuvants can help correct this. Aluminum-containing adjuvants have been used in vaccines since the 1930s in small enough quantities to not cause any harm. Other adjuvants include different lipid formulations and a synthetic form of DNA that mimics bacterial and viral genetic material. Vaccine adjuvants will likely be important to induce strong and durable protection in older adults whose immune systems are less responsive as they age. Vaccines with adjuvants can cause more local reactions, such as redness, swelling, and pain at the injection site, and more systemic reactions such as fever, chills, and body aches, than non-adjuvanted vaccines.\\n\\n## Viral vector vaccines\\n\\nViral vector vaccines use another non-replicating virus to deliver SARS-CoV-2 genes, in the form of DNA, into human cells where viral proteins are produced to induce protective immune responses. This viral DNA is not integrated into the host genome (i.e.., all of the body\u2019s DNA) but is transcribed or copied into messenger RNA and translated into proteins. Current SARS-CoV-2 viral vectored vaccines use non-replicating human or chimpanzee adenoviruses, including those by AstraZeneca with the University of Oxford, Johnson & Johnson, CanSino Biologics, and the Gamaleya Research Institute, part of Russia\u2019s Ministry of Health.  \\n\\nAdenoviruses are a group of approximately 50 common viruses that can cause cold-like symptoms, fever, sore throat, diarrhea, and pink eye. The human adenovirus vectors used for SARS-CoV-2 are weakened forms of adenovirus 5 and adenovirus 26. The weakened vectors do not replicate because important genes have been deleted. These vaccines will likely require at least two doses, although there is some hope that a single dose may induce protective immune responses.\\n\\nViral vectors have been studied for several decades for gene therapy, to treat cancer, and for research into molecular biology as well as for vaccines. Viral vectors other than adenoviruses include retroviruses and the vaccinia virus that was used to prevent smallpox. In July 2020, the European Commission approved use of an adenovirus 26 vaccine for Ebola that was manufactured by Johnson & Johnson, the first adenovirus vectored vaccine approved for use in humans, and the same vaccine platform used by Johnson & Johnson for their SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Large-scale production of viral vector vaccines requires cultivation of the viral vector, such as adenovirus, in cell cultures and virus purification. \\n\\nMost people have been exposed to multiple adenoviruses and thus have pre-existing immunity that could impair vector entry into host cells. This is a potential limitation of viral vector vaccines using human adenoviruses. The AstraZeneca and University of Oxford vaccine uses a chimpanzee adenovirus as vector, thus minimizing the risk of pre-existing immunity to the vector that might reduce vaccine efficacy.\\n\\n## Genetic vaccines\\n\\nInstead of using a viral vector to deliver SARS-CoV-2 virus genes to human cells, the genes can be administered directly as either DNA or RNA. Several of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines furthest along in phase 3 trials are messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines that deliver the spike protein gene, including those by Moderna, BioNTec with Pfizer, CureVac, and Imperial College London. Once the genetic sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was known in January 2020, it was relatively straightforward to generate genetic vaccine candidates. mRNA vaccines are easier to develop and manufacture compared to other vaccine types as they do not require cultivating viruses in cells. This is why they were some of the first SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to enter human trials. However, no mRNA vaccine has previously been licensed and approved for humans and most experience with this technology in humans has been for the treatment of cancer.\\n\\nmRNA vaccines are taken up into cells, but do not need to enter the nucleus to trick the body into producing viral proteins, which then induce immune responses. RNA is particularly potent at inducing innate immune response, the earliest type of response to a pathogen that prevents spread within the body. mRNA is used by the cell as a template to build a protein through the process of translation.\\n\\nEarly phase 1 and 2 studies of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines show these vaccines induce immune responses likely to be protective, including in older adults. However, until phase 3 clinical trials are completed, the safety, efficacy, and duration of protection from mRNA vaccines will not be known and at least two doses will be required.\\n\\n## Advantages and disadvantages of different vaccine types\\n\\nUntil completion of the phase 3 clinical trials, we will not know the safety and efficacy of the different types of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and their relative advantages and disadvantages. It will be important to not only monitor short-term vaccine safety, such as soreness and fever, but the risk of long-term adverse events such as enhanced disease following exposure to natural infection and autoimmune diseases. Of particular interest will be vaccine effectiveness in vulnerable populations such as older adults and those with underlying medical conditions, including diabetes, HIV infection, and chronic heart, kidney, and lung diseases. Protein-based vaccines with adjuvants may be the most likely to induce protective immune responses in elderly adults with weakened immune systems. These different vaccine types will not be interchangeable. Once a vaccine is selected, the same vaccine must be used for a second dose if required. \\n\\nMany of the vaccines furthest along in development are those for which vaccine delivery platforms existed. mRNA vaccines were developed rapidly after the SARS-CoV-2 genome was sequenced and manufacturing capacity can be rapidly scaled-up. However, some mRNA vaccines have stringent cold chain requirements. The Pfizer and BioNTech mRNA will need to be stored at -70oC until about 48 hours prior to use, when it can be refrigerated, because of the instability of RNA, while the Moderna mRNA vaccine may require storage at -20oC until about one week prior to use. Freezers with the capacity to hold large volumes of vaccine at this temperature will be needed and are not currently part of the existing vaccine supply cold chain.\\n","legacyIsNew":null,"isDrafted":null,"order":null,"date":"10/06/20","attachments":[],"verticals":[],"authors":["william-moss","lois-privor-dumm"]},{"id":30,"slug":"economics-of-covid-19-vaccines","meta":{"path":"/vaccines/report/economics-of-covid-19-vaccines","title":"Economics of COVID-19 Vaccines","description":"This primer outlines key terms and concepts related to COVID-19 vaccines and is intended for members of the general public, policy makers, educators, and key stakeholders.","image":""},"section":"Vaccine Reports","title":"Economics of COVID-19 Vaccines","subtitle":"","caption":"This primer outlines key terms and concepts related to COVID-19 vaccines and is intended for members of the general public, policy makers, educators, and key stakeholders.","content":"There are over a hundred vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 in development, including at least 54 vaccines [currently being tested](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html) on human subjects \\\\[1\\\\]. Many biotechnological companies and partnerships are involved, collaborating and competing against each other to develop and produce effective and safe vaccines. As the promise of restoring business activities and freedom of movement fuels our attention to the vaccine race, there are several economic questions that remain unanswered:  \\n\\n- What is the economic value of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2?  \\n- What will influence the price of the vaccines?  \\n- What other costs for vaccine rollout should be considered?  \\n- What financing mechanisms are in place to cover those costs?  \\n\\n### What is the economic value of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2?  \\n\\nTo estimate the economic value of a preventive measure, economists typically assess the costs associated with the disease prevented. Most often, those costs consist of the average medical and non-medical costs incurred by an individual, the health system, or society, including insurance reimbursement payments and out-of-pocket payments for items such as diagnostic tests, medications, hospitalization, and transportation to and from healthcare facilities. These costs also include indirect costs due to productivity loss, such as lost wages due to illness, disability, or premature death. The classic approach to assessing cost-of-illness assumes that the total cost is encompassed by these medical and non-medical costs. Yet these estimates may [undervalue the broader economic impact on society](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/34/12313) \\\\[2\\\\].  \\n\\nThe considerable economic and social toll caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, however, extends well beyond direct health costs. In addition to costs incurred due to COVID-19 itself, medical and health system accrue additional costs due to delayed elective procedures, forgone routine preventive health services (e.g., vaccination and cancer screenings) during lockdown periods, reduced ability to treat patients due to overcrowding of healthcare facilities with COVID-19 cases, and delays in care-seeking by individuals fearful of COVID-19.  \\n\\nIn addition to health sector costs, the necessary business restrictions and lockdowns used as preventive measures \u2013 and resulting changes to consumer behavior \u2013 expanded the productivity loss beyond the health system and those infected. As such, economists cannot resort to traditional cost-effectiveness or cost-of-illness analysis as many of the benefits of preventing or treating COVID-19 are not health-related. To assess these broader impacts requires economists to forecast economic recovery as well as predict where the global economy would be in the absence of COVID-19.\\n  \\nIn addition to quantifying the economic value of returning to normalcy for business activities, other non-health benefits are known to economists and a few can be quantified and costed. Based on a [report](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29477390/) from the Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR), [Garrison Jr. et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28237197/) and [Kamal-Bahl et al.](https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20200616.451000/full/) suggested consideration of additional types of non-health-related costs \\\\[3-5\\\\]:  \\n\\n\\n| Non-health costs | There is value in\u2026 | Reference |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| *Fear of contagion* | Reducing the fear of contagion in a pandemic and alleviating concerns attached to the freedom of movement and to congregate. | \\\\[4\\\\] |\\n| *Severity of disease* | Avoiding getting sick from a potentially lethal or debilitating disease. | \\\\[4\\\\] |\\n| *Insurance value* | Reducing a person\u2019s physical and financial risk in this pandemic. | \\\\[4, 5\\\\] |\\n| *Reduction in uncertainty* | Increasing the \u201cvalue of knowing\u201d and limiting the uncertainty by reducing the probability of disability or death. | \\\\[4, 5\\\\] |\\n| *Value of hope* | Increasing a patient\u2019s value of the vaccine beyond the average gain in quality-adjusted life years (QALY). | \\\\[4, 5\\\\] |\\n| *Scientific spillovers* | Increasing the scientific knowledge in vaccine development and rollout, and disease prevention, thus paving the way for more effective vaccines and vaccine rollouts. | \\\\[4, 5\\\\] |\\n| *Equity* | Reducing the risk associated with the disease in vulnerable populations and in populations most affected by it. | \\\\[4\\\\] |\\n\\n\\nEquity, while missing from many economic analyses, is important to consider when rolling out COVID-19 vaccines as deviations from perceived or explicit fairness may result in backlash and future hesitancy. The plan outlined by the United States National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine prioritizes vaccine allocation for first responders, high-risk health workers, and vulnerable populations. In the United States, since the first vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) received Emergency Use Authorization on December 11, 2020, over three million doses were distributed to healthcare facilities in all 50 states \\\\[6\\\\]. It is worth noting that the vaccine rollout is not managed centrally in the United States, but by each state. Each state\u2019s prioritization may differ from the National Academies\u2019 recommendations.  \\n\\nGiven the impact of COVID-19 on health systems across the globe \u2013 one of the largest disruptions to economic activity in modern history \u2013 the broader benefits of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, along with reducing the need or intensity of future lockdowns and restrictions, most likely far outweigh the expected costs of vaccination globally \\\\[7\\\\].  \\n\\n### What will influence the price of the vaccines?  \\n\\nThe price of vaccine doses is driven by two costs: the cost of research and development (R&D) and the cost of production and manufacturing.  \\n\\nA vaccine\u2019s R&D costs can be hard to quantify as they include the cost of unsuccessful candidates and profits foregone \\\\[8\\\\]. Medications and other treatments included, only 0.01-0.02% of compounds screened are ultimately FDA-approved for sale \\\\[9\\\\]. R&D cost is also influenced by startup production, clinical trials, and regulatory processes \\\\[8-10\\\\]. Traditionally, R&D often has high sunk costs as most research facilities are vaccine-specific and there often exists a long lag time between production and sales. To produce novel vaccines, the R&D cost may be higher than for established vaccines; new and technologically advanced vaccines often have higher production costs and are likely to be on the market for shorter time periods as they may be quickly replaced by combination vaccines \\\\[10\\\\]. This said, the Advanced Market Commitment \u2013 \u201ca legally-binding agreement for an amount of funds to subsidize the purchase, at a given price, of an as yet unavailable vaccine against a specific disease causing high morbidity and mortality in developing countries\u201d \\\\[11\\\\] \u2013 and overall interest in COVID-19 vaccines will likely shorten any delay between production and sales.  \\n\\nManufacturing is a large part of the vaccine cost structure. Costs associated with administration, quality control, depreciation and other fixed costs account for 60% of the total vaccine manufacturing cost \\\\[12\\\\]. The manufacturing cost can be very high if the manufacturer does not have operational facilities in place. This production cost is influenced by vaccine type, time, unaccountable obstacles, and other simultaneous product development and production \\\\[8\\\\]. To date, the U.S. government alone has spent over $9 billion USD for the development of COVID-19 vaccines, with an additional $200M for vaccine preparedness \\\\[13, 14\\\\].  \\n\\nTherefore, the price of the vaccine often entails high sunk costs and high fixed costs with low marginal cost per dose. Nevertheless, in the case of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine production, governments, bilateral and multilateral organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and private companies are funding vaccine R&D and have signed contracts with vaccine manufacturers prior to vaccine approval. This increases incentives in producing the vaccines and lowers the risk of capital loss \\\\[15, 16\\\\].  \\n\\nSeveral laboratories developing vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are partnering with vaccine manufacturers to ease the transition from development to production (e.g., the Oxford University and Astra-Zeneca partnership and the NIH-Moderna partnership). Such partnerships allow phases II and III of clinical trials to occur while simultaneously building up production capacity, leading to a quicker rollout if the vaccine is approved.  \\n\\n### What other costs for vaccine rollout should be considered?  \\n\\nVaccine costs include more than just the price of vaccine supplies. The rollout costs for vaccines also include labor, cold chain storage, transportation, capital, and other recurrent costs including program management, training, social mobilization, waste management, and monitoring and evaluation \\\\[17\\\\]. These costs are considered immunization delivery costs. Based on the International Vaccine Access Center\u2019s recent study on childhood immunization program costing, delivery costs account for nearly half of the total immunization program costs, globally \\\\[17\\\\]. Delivery cost varies across regions, ranging from $0.18 to $11.31 per dose delivered, depending on accessibility and countries\u2019 infrastructure \\\\[17\\\\]. To minimize delivery costs and ensure efficient and equitable access to SAR-CoV-2 vaccines, governments need to leverage the strength of existing delivery infrastructure and integrate partnerships at all levels.  \\n\\nThe key challenge awaiting the rollout of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 is that, unlike most vaccines that target children, these vaccines will target adults \u2013 a larger and more difficult population to target effectively. Most countries lack the health system infrastructure or protocols to systematically administer vaccines to adults, particularly in harder-to-reach areas that are further from tertiary healthcare facilities. This is especially the case in low- and middle-income countries, where few policies exist for adult vaccines already on the market and adult vaccination in the private sector is less common. In addition, increased vaccine hesitancy and lack of vaccine confidence will hamper efforts to vaccinate large populations, even during a public health crisis \\\\[18-20\\\\]. This leads to higher wastage rates and costlier efforts in social mobilization through health communications and community engagement.  \\n\\nDifferent SARS-CoV-2 vaccines may have different requirements for storage and delivery, and procuring highly specialized equipment may be necessary. For instance, the biotechnology used for the mRNA vaccine developed by Pfizer requires storage at [minus 70 degrees Celsius](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/11/17/935563377/why-does-pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-need-to-be-kept-colder-than-antarctica), much colder than vaccines routinely used for childhood immunization \\\\[21\\\\]. Extreme cold chain requirements do not necessarily preclude low- and middle-income countries from using such a vaccine: several African countries used \u201cultra-cold\u201d refrigerators to store and deliver the Ebola vaccine in the past decade. However, countries without this infrastructure may opt to wait for a product with less stringent cold chain requirements.  \\n\\nThe high wastage rates associated with such a large-scale operation could be an opportunity for several companies to offer new injection technologies. For instance, [ApiJect Systems](https://www.npr.org/2020/11/19/936207326/as-vaccine-approvals-loom-u-s-funds-a-back-up-plan-for-delivery) developed an injection platform to replace the glass vials currently used to transport and store vaccine doses, aiming to significantly reduce any wastage at the time of vaccination \\\\[22\\\\]. The company has applied for U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval.  \\n\\n### What financing mechanisms are in place to cover those costs?\\n  \\nMultiple high-income country governments have signed contracts and developed partnerships with R&D and manufacturing companies to cover procurement costs and secure COVID-19 vaccines once released, including the U.S., China, Canada, Japan, and Australia \\\\[23\\\\]. To ensure equitable and affordable access for all countries, international initiatives addressing public financing for COVID-19 vaccines are essential. The Gavi AMC for COVID-19 vaccines (COVAX), convened by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, Gavi, and the World Health Organization (WHO), has created the world\u2019s largest and most diverse COVID-19 vaccine portfolio to accelerate affordable access to COVID-19 vaccines \\\\[24\\\\]. COVAX is one of the three pillars of the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-Accelerator), a global collaboration between the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, CEPI, Gavi, The Global Fund, Unitaid, Wellcome Trust, the WHO, and the World Bank \\\\[25\\\\].  \\n\\nCOVAX uses financing mechanisms similar to previous AMCs aimed at promoting equitable access to pneumococcal and Ebola vaccines \\\\[26\\\\]. COVAX incentivized vaccine manufacturers to invest in production capacity by guaranteeing purchasing volumes before a vaccine is licensed. The 92 AMC-eligible countries \u2013 Gross National Income (GNI) per capita under US$4,000 and World Bank International Development Association (IDA) eligible \u2013 will be able to access the subsidized vaccine cost (up to US$1.60 \u2013 US$2 per dose) while fully self-financing countries can either participate in a Committed Purchase Arrangement or Optional Purchase Arrangement \\\\[24, 27, 28\\\\].  \\n\\nCommitted Purchase requires the country participants to pay US$1.60 per dose upfront or 15% of the price per dose and commit to pay the rest of the balance later. The Optional Purchase country participants will have to provide higher upfront payment of US$3.50 per dose (US$3.10 per dose plus a risk-sharing guarantee of US$0.40 per dose) but have the ability to opt out without penalty \\\\[24\\\\]. Through COVAX, no receiving country (the AMC-eligible economies) will be able to secure vaccine doses for more than 20% of its population until all countries have received sufficient doses for at least 20% of their population \\\\[24, 27-29\\\\].  \\n\\nCurrently, COVAX has raised US$1.4 billion toward the efforts and is aiming to raise at least US$2 billion by the end of 2020 \\\\[24\\\\]. As of November 24, 2020, 184 countries were participating in COVAX, including 94 low- and middle-income countries eligible to access the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines through Gavi\u2019s COVAX Advance Market Commitment \\\\[30\\\\].  \\n\\nThe considerable public investments in research and development and the manufacturing of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have shifted much of the financial risk away from the pharmaceutical industry, thus reducing the vaccines\u2019 cost and accelerating production. With such terms, governments are left to ensure that their health systems have the adequate cold chain and infrastructure to store and deliver those vaccines. Countries with limited resources to adjust their cold chain will benefit from other vaccines currently nearing approval (as of December 14, 2020) with less constricting requirements. Low- and middle-income countries will benefit from Gavi support through the Advanced Market Commitment, which implies a staged worldwide distribution of the new vaccines: all countries will receive vaccines at the same rate. With these mechanisms in place, we hope that vaccines will be available to all, everywhere, and without any financial challenges.  \\n\\n---  \\n\\nReferences:  \\n1. Corum, J., S.-L. Wee, and C.

More than 40 million vaccine doses could be available by the end of 2020, enough to vaccinate more than 20 million people. If multiple vaccine manufacturers are successful, hundreds of millions of doses could be available in 2021. But, with a world population of 7.8 billion, including the United States (U.S.) population of nearly 330 million, there will not be sufficient doses for all who need or want to be vaccinated. Until enough vaccine is available for the general population, doses will need to be given to priority groups. This primer uses the framework established by the National Academies to examine who may have access to Covid-19 vaccines in the U.S.\\n\\n#### Lessons from Prior Pandemics\\n\\nThis is not the first time the U.S. has deliberated prioritization of vaccines during a pandemic. For example, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services developed a *Pandemic Influenza Plan* that included recommendations on the prioritization of influenza vaccines. The plan identified four tiers and eight sub-tiers of population groups to prioritize the order in which individuals should be vaccinated during an influenza pandemic. The first tier included health care workers, those at high risk of severe disease due to underlying conditions, pregnant women, household contacts of those at high risk, emergency response workers, government workers, and, interestingly, vaccine and antiviral drug manufacturers. \\n\\nWhen the H1N1 influenza pandemic came in 2009, vaccine manufacturing and distribution faced challenges despite pandemic planning. Vaccine production was slow because of the need to grow influenza virus in eggs for vaccine production, a problem not faced with Covid-19 vaccines. With H1N1, by the time many vaccine doses were available, the second wave of influenza virus transmission had largely passed. In the end, only about one-quarter of the general population in the U.S. was vaccinated and one-third of those in priority groups. \\n\\nThe H1N1 experience has some similarities to Covid-19 vaccine allocation. The federal government purchased all of the vaccines and distributed doses to states based on population size, similar to what may happen with Covid-19 vaccines. States then decided how best to distribute vaccine doses to providers, although getting the influenza vaccine to adults was \u2013 and remains \u2013 a challenge. \\n\\n#### National Academies\u2019 Framework for Equitable Allocation of Covid-19 Vaccine\\n\\nSeveral efforts have been made to develop guiding principles and frameworks for the allocation of Covid-19 vaccines in the U.S. The first was developed by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and published in August 2020, titled *Interim Framework for COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation and Distribution in the United States*. Subsequently, the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine published the *Framework for Equitable Allocation of COVID-19 Vaccine* at the request of the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The National Academies were charged with developing a framework to assist policy-makers in planning for equitable allocation of Covid-19 vaccines. This framework is expected to heavily influence Covid-19 vaccine allocation and prioritization in the U.S. At the federal level, allocation decisions will be made by the CDC with input from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), although each state will have responsibility for implementing the plan. As described below, the National Academies\u2019 *Framework for Equitable Allocation of COVID-19 Vaccine* lays out the goal, foundational principles, and four allocation phases.\\n\\n#### Goal of Equitable Allocation of Covid-19 Vaccines\\n\\nThe goal of the equitable allocation of Covid-19 vaccines is to reduce severe morbidity and mortality and negative societal impact due to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.\\n\\n#### Foundational Principles\\n\\nConceptualizing a framework for the equitable allocation of vaccines often begins with consideration of foundational principles that guide the decision-making process for prioritization. The *Framework for Equitable Allocation of COVID-19 Vaccine* lays out three ethical principles and three procedural principles that guided the allocation framework. The three ethical principles are:  \\n1. maximum benefit to protect and promote the public\u2019s health and socioeconomic well-being;  \\n2. equal concern so that every person be considered and treated as having equal dignity, worth, and value; and  \\n3. mitigation of health inequities to explicitly address the higher burden of Covid-19 in populations at high risk of exposure and compounding health inequities.  \\n\\nThe three procedural principles are:  \\n1. fairness;  \\n2. transparency; and  \\n3. evidence-based.  \\n\\n#### Covid-19 Vaccine Allocation\\n\\nThe *Framework for Equitable Allocation of COVID-19 Vaccine* proposes a phased approach to the allocation of Covid-19 vaccines. The use of the word \u201cphases\u201d rather than \u201ctiers\u201d reflects the temporal nature of the process and de-emphasizes a hierarchical allocation framework. The four phases encompass increasingly larger groups based on risk of exposure and disease severity. \\n\\nPhase 1 includes high-risk health workers, first responders, people at significantly higher risk of severe disease due to underlying conditions, and older adults living in congregate or overcrowded settings. Phase 2 comprises K-12 teachers and staff, critical workers in high-risk industries, people at moderately higher risk of severe disease due to underlying conditions, people in homeless shelters or group homes, people in prisons or jails, and older adults not included in Phase 1. Phase 3 further expands Covid-19 vaccine allocation to all children, young adults, and additional workers in important industries and occupations. Finally, Phase 4 includes everyone else residing in the U.S, a phase that may be reached by the summer or fall of 2021. Although the framework does not specifically identify racial or ethnic groups, there is recognition of the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 in African-American and Latinx communities due to systemic racism that yields higher rates of underlying diseases, living conditions that contribute to disease risk, and greater employment as essential workers with increased exposure risk to SARS-CoV-2. These equity factors were considered in the framework\u2019s development.\\n\\n#### Federal Guidelines on Covid-19 Vaccine Allocation\\n\\nFederal guidelines on the allocation of Covid-19 vaccines in the U.S. will be issued by the CDC. Final allocation decisions have not been made but will be based on input from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). Shortly after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorizes or approves a Covid-19 vaccine, the ACIP will hold a public meeting to review available data on vaccine safety and efficacy and will vote on whether to recommend the vaccine. If a recommendation is made, the ACIP will also provide guidance on who should receive the vaccine. These recommendations must be approved by the director of the CDC before becoming official CDC policy.\\n\\nThe ACIP met on November 23rd to discuss phased Covid-19 vaccine allocation and published, on the same day, ethical principles for allocating initial supplies of Covid-19 vaccines. These ethical principles include:  \\n1. maximize benefits and minimize harms;  \\n2. promote justice;  \\n3. mitigate health inequities; and  \\n4. promote transparency.  \\n\\nAlthough the ACIP did not vote on a vaccine allocation plan, they deliberated who within the U.S. would be prioritized to receive Covid-19 vaccines in Phase 1. Specifically, the ACIP discussed the proposal that Phase 1a include health care personnel  and residents of long-term care facilities, Phase 1b include other non-health care essential workers (e.g., police, firefighters, and those in education, transportation, and food services), and Phase 1c include adults 65 years and older and those with high-risk medical conditions (e.g., obesity, diabetes, and chronic lung, heart, and kidney conditions). The FDA is scheduled to meet on December 10th to review Emergency Use Authorization applications for Covid-19 vaccines, and the ACIP is expected to meet and vote shortly afterward. Federal guidelines on Covid-19 vaccine allocation in the U.S. will then be issued by the CDC.\\n\\n#### Role of Sub-National Governments\\n\\nUltimately, state, tribal, local, and territorial jurisdictions will be responsible for Covid-19 vaccine allocation and distribution, with guidance and support from the federal government, including the CDC. The federal government has asked states to submit interim draft Covid-19 vaccination plans. These plans are what will ultimately determine who receives a Covid-19 vaccine and when, and allocation plans may vary across states. These state plans will be modified based on vaccine safety and efficacy data for particular populations or risk groups as well as distribution and storage requirements as vaccines receive Emergency Use Authorization and biological licensure from the FDA. Distribution and storage requirements vary by vaccine type, with the Pfizer mRNA vaccine requiring ultracold storage temperatures, and states will need to be prepared to meet these requirements. \\n\\nThere are unverified rumors that Santa Claus and his elves may be among the essential workers prioritized to receive the first Covid-19 vaccine doses in mid-December, in time for the holiday season. \\n\\n---\\n\\n#### Resources\\n\\n*Interim Framework for COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation and Distribution in the United States*.

Childhood constitutes the most vulnerable period for falling seriously ill with vaccine-preventable illnesses, and hence this is the period when protection is most needed. Their na\xefve immune systems are quick to react to antigens presented to them as vaccines, often resulting in long-term immunity against disease. Children can be walking petri dishes and are capable of carrying pathogens and transmitting infection to others, thus protecting them with vaccines may help reduce transmission within the community.  \\n\\nThe glimmer of hope for a COVID-19 vaccine that was nursed guardedly in the early part of 2020 has erupted into a glorious blaze of promise as the global scientific community has produced over a hundred vaccine candidates and several vaccines approved for emergency use among vulnerable people. Phase III clinical trials indicate that these vaccines are over 90% efficacious with clear safety profiles so far. Uncommon speed, unprecedented global collaboration, and unequivocal public and private sector support have marked the development of these vaccines. The first group of people who are being vaccinated are healthcare workers, the elderly, and those with serious underlying conditions.  \\n\\nWhile there are several looming questions about the nature of COVID-19 vaccine deployment, other questions that come to the fore are about children and youth: when will they be considered for vaccination? Let us consider the broad reasons for including children among COVID-19 vaccine recipients in the near-term.  \\n\\n### Five reasons why children should get a COVID-19 vaccine  \\n\\nFirst, children under the age of 18 years form a large proportion of the population ([24% in the US](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-kits/2020/population-estimates-detailed.html) and [32% globally](https://population.un.org/wpp/DataQuery/)). Ensuring protection to a group that constitutes a quarter of the total population seems essential as we progress towards control of the pandemic.  \\n\\nSecond, it is well known that children can efficiently transmit SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has shown through contact tracing data that [infants and children can transmit the virus to their household contacts](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6937e3.htm). This is a familiar phenomenon seen with other dangerous pathogens such as pneumococcus. In countries where there was good coverage of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine among children, [adults who were unimmunized appeared to be protected and showed lower rates of pneumonia](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28449971/). These observations suggest that vaccinating children can reduce the overall burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection.  \\n\\nThird, while children are not the ones to suffer most from COVID-19, they can fall seriously ill. In November 2020, the [American Academy of Pediatrics reported that over one million children in the US were infected with SARS-CoV-2](https://www.aappublications.org/news/2020/11/16/covid19children111620), indicating that over one in ten cases is a child. Although overall mortality among children has been low, hundreds have died and many thousands have been seriously ill with an inflammatory condition called [Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C)](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2021680).  \\n\\nFourth, the indirect effects of COVID-19 on children have been devastating. Education is clearly suffering and 2020 is a lost year for a generation of children. [Analysis in county public schools](https://go.boarddocs.com/vsba/fairfax/Board.nsf/files/BVJV847F7247/$file/Q1%20Marks%20Rpt%20-%20v6%20lzh.pdf) indicated an increase in the proportion of children with failing grades during the COVID-19 era of remote learning. [Pediatric emergency department visits for mental health issues](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6945a3.htm?s_cid=mm6945a3_w) have been on the rise, with increases in anxiety and social isolation seen among children and families. A COVID-19 vaccine for children would provide a safer educational environment and would support re-opening of schools for in-person learning and other co-curricular activities.  \\n\\nFifth, the application of the ethical principle of distributive justice that expresses the ideal that benefits and burdens are distributed among society\'s members in a just manner, means that children should not be excluded from consideration for receiving COVID-19 vaccines, as noted in a [letter by the president of the American Academy of Pediatrics to federal health officials](https://downloads.aap.org/DOFA/AAPLettertoHHSandFDAChildreninCOVID19VaccineTrials.pdf). The observation that children appear to have lower risk of severe COVID-19 disease compared with adults [should not result in their exclusion from vaccine clinical research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32379296/).  \\n\\n### Including children in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials  \\n\\nBefore we reach the point of planning for children to get COVID-19 vaccines, it is essential to include children in vaccine clinical trials right away to glean critical information on the safety and efficacy of these vaccines in children.  \\n\\nIt is well known that children are not \u2018little adults\u2019 \u2013 their physical, metabolic, immunological, and psychological processes are different from those of adults. Younger children have more active immune responses to vaccines than adults that often translate to children having stronger reactions, such as higher fever and localized reactions. Thus, separate safety data in children must be meticulously collected and critically studied before recommendations can be made for deployment in children. Similarly, efficacy data are important to compile in different age categories given the differential immune responses in different ages. Initiating Phase 2 studies in children simultaneously with Phase 3 studies among adults to identify optimal pediatric doses would also increase the efficiency of conducting Phase 3 trials in children.  \\n\\nIn July 2020, the [FDA issued an emergency use authorization for remdesivir](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-issues-emergency-use-authorization-potential-covid-19-treatment) that included children although no pediatric data were available. While it may be argued that the inclusion is acceptable for drugs that work by interfering with SARS-CoV-2 replication, in the case of vaccines, there are additonal factors to consider. Hence it is imperative to include children in vaccine trials at the earliest possible time. The argument may be extended to state that, given adolescents\u2019 physiologic similarity to adults and the advantage of gaining knowledge expeditiously, [the inclusion of adolescents in adult trials may be justifiable](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32639464/). Including different age categories of children can make the clinical trial a lengthy process, called age de-escalation. These trials may start with older children initially and continue the step-down process by including younger age groups, all the while carefully monitoring safety and efficacy and often adjusting vaccine doses.  \\n\\n### A few words of caution\\n\\nA dollop of caution and realism will go a long way when keeping track of goals and activities for the best and most successful outcomes.  \\n\\nA peculiar immunological phenomenon to watch out for is called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), in which [antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 elicited from a vaccine may result in worse disease](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-00789-5#:~:text=Data%20from%20the%20study%20of,%2Ddependent%20enhancement%20(ADE).). Previous experience from other vaccine trials of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and dengue virus vaccine have resulted in this outcome, resulting in heavy risks and failed vaccine trials. Thus, long-term monitoring of vaccine safety within trials and in the general population is critical to building a strong safety profile of the vaccine products that are to be used in children.  \\n\\nRunning pediatric vaccine trials is more complicated compared to adult trials and an integrated and sustainable trials network geared towards pediatric approaches is necessary. Previously, [approval of a product for pediatric use](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/information-consumers-and-patients-drugs/drug-research-and-children) used to take approximately nine years after approval of a product for adult use. The barriers include operational, informational and ethical factors. A key gathering of stakeholders in November 2014 addressed the challenges in conducting clinical trials by establishing a [pediatric clinical trials network](https://www.nature.com/articles/pr2015255). Such a network, run by dedicated personnel with expertise in conducting trials in children, would provide the infrastructure and rigor needed to improve the safety and efficacy of products for children, including vaccines.  \\n\\nFinally, an open channel of communication with the public with complete transparency of what is known and unknown is urgently needed to build vaccine confidence. Current and future trial enrollments should reflect the racial and ethnic diversity of the US and global populations, including children and pregnant women, and contribute to reducing inequities among societies.  \\n\\nThe vaccine made by Pfizer/BioNTech is now being tested in children aged 12-17 years since October 2020. Similarly, Moderna initiated trials in children 12 years and above and will include approximately 3,000 children. AstraZeneca has also tested its vaccine in children in the UK and US, and has been one of the earliest to include young children. However, there is still much learning to be had and this is a rapidly evolving field that is being watched at close quarters by the entire world.  \\n\\nChildren\u2019s overall risk of COVID-19 is not insignificant. When the stage is reached where COVID-19 vaccines can be deployed among children, we would have truly reached a pinnacle of success, where a large proportion of the adults would have been vaccinated and sufficient vaccine doses would have been manufactured and ready for shipping to children. Understanding the impact of COVID-19 vaccines in children is the pathway towards making the world a safer place.

The very encouraging early results from the efficacy trials of both the Moderna and Pfizer messenger RNA (mRNA) candidate products \u2013 and the submission of the first emergency use authorization request from Pfizer to the FDA \u2013 means that the era of vaccine implementation may be fast approaching. No matter how many candidate products may be available in the coming months, this early phase will be marked by scarcity of vaccine and by a complex set of challenges around allocation, access, and equity. There is little disagreement that frontline health care workers need to be protected right away, and that other first responders with direct contact with the public will need protection too. After that, it gets more complicated. Should we focus on immunizing the frailer elderly? Those in nursing homes or other congregate housing? Those with the highest burdens of COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths, such as persons with chronic health conditions known to be associated with poor outcomes from COVID-19? And what about those from ethnic and racial minority communities who have experienced such marked health disparities with COVID-19? \\n\\nAs important as our ethical and allocation frameworks will be, the uptake and use of these candidate vaccines will only be as effective as individual, family, and community willingness to be immunized. And this is the first of several reasons why the COVID Vaccine Prevention Network, the Co-VPN, has been so committed to increasing minority participation in its trials. The Co-VPN needs to understand the efficacy of these products in hard-hit communities, but we knew from past experience that, if trials do not include Black and Brown Americans, uptake could be markedly lower among these communities.\\n\\nA second reason why diversity and inclusion matter in these trials is an epidemiologic one. A basic principle of epidemic spread of diseases is what is known as the force of infection. In any community with low rates of transmission, each individual\u2019s odds of infection are a function of both their risks and the community rate. A person at low risk, working from home, mask-wearing when doing essential outside tasks like food shopping, may have very little risk of acquiring COVID-19, and if community rates are low, even that modest risk goes down. When more community transmission is underway, however, everyone in that community has greater odds of exposure. When community transmission rates are very high, which we are unfortunately seeing across the country right now, all are at greater risk of exposure, and of acquiring SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. That is the force of infection. But that force is not evenly distributed across towns and cities, rural areas, and the suburbs. People who have direct contact with the public \u2013 such as health care workers, essential workers, people working in pharmacies \u2013 all have higher likelihood of exposure. So do those who use public transport to get to work or school, and so do those who live in more densely populated areas, in more crowded housing, and in congregate housing \u2013 like nursing home staff and residents, but also people housed in jails, prisons, and other detention facilities. These individuals, families, and communities face much greater force of infection risks. For Black Americans, this has translated into increased rates as high as 62/10,000 persons; for Latinx people in the U.S., it is 73/10,000 persons, compared to 23/10,000 for non-Hispanic Whites<sup>i</sup> Testing vaccine efficacy in these communities is not about racial or ethnic differences, but instead about testing whether these vaccines can protect when there is a high force of infection. It\u2019s literally a higher bar for the vaccines and we have to know which of the candidates does this well and safely.\\n\\nBut there are additional realities we have to consider. The indigenous and racial and ethnic minority communities hardest hit by COVID-19 disease share a legacy of having experienced abusive policies and practices, creating social and economic circumstances compromising community health and well-being. This reality, coupled with continued marginalization and the relative lack of inclusion and representation in science and medicine, have fostered mistrust of medical and research establishments. This reality and the need to ensure that indigenous peoples and people of color are equitably included in COVID-19 research have been central tenets in efforts to engage and include diverse participants in our clinical trials. Successful public health efforts that benefit everyone require a social justice lens ensuring the equitable distribution of resources among all members of society. For COVID-19, as with all public health efforts, equitable inclusion is required at the earliest stages of research in humans. This inclusion is critical if trust is to be built. Inclusion in research increases knowledge and familiarity with the research process, builds relationships between community members and research institutions, increases the availability of important resources for the larger community, and cultivates the trust in research we so urgently need. \\n\\nThe importance of inclusion and diversity in the COVID-19 vaccine trials has also been recognized by federal leadership. Indeed, one company, Moderna, was asked to slow its recruitment rate and focus on greater recruitment of Black and Latinx volunteers in its efficacy trial, since the early recruitment data suggested that the trial would not have sufficient numbers of minority participants to answer the critical question of vaccine efficacy in these populations. Again, this is not because of possible genetic differences, but rather that the force of infection is so much greater for these communities. And this decision was also likely motivated by the very real need to address the concerns about vaccine hesitancy in communities of color, should their participation rates in trials be too low.\\n\\nIt is not clear that these kinds of efforts will continue in the trials to come, since there is greater urgency to complete these trials now that there has been an emergency use authorization application from one sponsor, and the period of placebo-controlled trials may soon end. Once we have a licensed vaccine for COVID-19, many would argue that trials must randomize participants to compare the new vaccine against that product, making the subsequent trials much larger, slower, and more expensive. Nevertheless, there is no question that it is vitally important \u2013 for both the science and the social justice issues \u2013 that every effort be made to ensure the COVID-19 vaccine trials are diverse, inclusive, and can accurately assess the safety and efficacy of these products for the communities most affected by this pandemic.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<sup>i</sup> The Fullest Look Yet at the Racial Inequity of Coronavirus.

When one reads the trial protocols,<sup>1 2 3 4 </sup> one sees that the primary endpoint of the OWS vaccine trials is a reduction of coronavirus disease, which includes reducing the signs and symptoms of mild COVID-19 illness (e.g., headache, cough, fever, myalgias, signs of loss of taste and smell).\\n  \\nBy including mild COVID-19 disease within a primary endpoint, the trials can evaluate the vast disease spectrum of COVID-19. This approach will ultimately allow for widespread licensure and efficient real-world rapid assessment of the vaccines\u2019 effect on COVID-19. For companies developing vaccines, inclusion of mild COVID-19 disease within a primary endpoint for the OWS trials makes sense; these companies recognize the wide range of COVID-19 disease, from mild to severe, and want to produce an effective vaccine with widespread benefit.  \\n\\nImportantly, reading further into the vaccine trial protocols reveals a deeper evaluation of disease severity within each of the OWS studies: the trials have an endpoint that includes measurement of disease severity at diagnosis and over three-weeks of follow-up for every participant who develops COVID-19. If one looks in the tables at the end of the protocols, (Table 17 in the Moderna protocol,<sup>5</sup>  Table 4 in the AstraZeneca protocol,<sup>6</sup> and Appendices 2, 6-8 in the Janssen protocol<sup>7</sup>), one sees that every person in the trials with COVID-19 infection is intensively followed from the time of diagnosis over the next three weeks with standardized assessments of their signs and symptoms, including the use of medical facilities, hospitalizations, and what as investigators we all hope is rare \u2013 death.  \\n\\nAt the time the vaccine trials were designed, there was no consensus about the frequency with which those who were willing to enroll would acquire COVID-19 and, more importantly, what the spectrum of COVID-19 disease among trial participants would be. In fact, we were pretty certain we would not see what, at that point, had been the norm in the pandemic (i.e., large numbers of people presenting to hospital emergency rooms with full-blown end-stage pneumonia). We suspected that in the trials we would see almost the opposite of this \u2013 participants presenting earlier and with milder COVID-19 symptoms than what was, at that time, being seen in medical practice or in any published cohorts of persons.  \\n\\nPersons who enroll in a clinical trial, especially of the complexity seen in the COVID-19 vaccine efficacy trials, generally have to be interested and concerned about the disease. And, the design of the OWS trials involves active disease surveillance and no barrier to COVID-19 testing for 30,000 participants per study. Moreover, these 30,000 participants are knowledgeable about COVID-19, likely anxious about getting COVID-19, and the trials make them attuned to any aspect of the disease, all the time. Participants in the trial receive weekly calls/texts about coming to the clinic at the first signs of any respiratory illness or fever and, importantly, trial participants have essentially unlimited access to COVID-19 testing. Thus, we felt that classification of COVID-19 disease severity at the time of diagnosis would not really provide an accurate reflection of a participant\u2019s COVID-19 illness. We expected that most trial participants would get worse after an initial diagnosis of COVID-19 and, as such, the real endpoint evaluation of disease severity \u2013 and hence the ultimate \u201cprimary endpoint\u201d \u2013 would be the constellation of signs and symptoms that were collected over the two to three weeks post-diagnosis. The section outlining the detailed follow-up of COVID-19 cases within each study had its own schematic diagrams/tables and was \u201ccosted out\u201d for site funding separately.  \\n\\nOne of the harmonizing aspects across all the vaccine trials is that participants with COVID-19 are queried daily with a standardized questionnaire evaluating their signs and symptoms on a mild-to-moderate-to-severe scale. Samples for viral shedding in saliva or the nose are taken every second to fourth day, depending on the protocol, to evaluate the duration for which the virus is shed. Duration of fever and pulse oximetry data are also recorded. These data allow one to grade the rate of progression, duration of symptoms, duration of signs, duration and severity of systemic effects, and need for any follow-up medical interventions (e.g., physician visits, telemedicine visits, ER visits, hospitalizations, and any complications of hospitalizations). Evaluations of these data are blinded and will be analyzed between the vaccinated and placebo recipients to determine whether disease duration and severity are reduced.  \\n\\nData outlined in the prior paragraph are listed as secondary endpoints in the trials and while \u201crelegated\u201d to this section, it does not mean their importance is secondary. This was highlighted in a recent paper on using burden of disease as the primary endpoint in COVID-19 vaccine studies by [Mehrotra and colleagues](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6169),<sup>8</sup> as well as recent analyses of data from the monoclonal antibody studies conducted by Lilly and Regeneron.<sup>9</sup> The monoclonal antibody studies do a nice job of aggregating medically complicated disease to show the benefits of early use of the antibodies. They also show one approach to compiling recorded signs and symptoms of COVID-19 to show clinical benefit to patients over time. This offers a model to structure analyses both within and between individual and collated vaccine studies. In addition, the prospective close follow-up that will occur in the vaccine studies lays the groundwork for future studies and maximizes what we learn from the 150 expected COVID-19 cases in each vaccine trial.  \\n\\nIt is unlikely that, in any individual trial, we will see enough hospitalization and death to evaluate efficacy of a vaccine versus placebo for severe COVID-19 disease. Obtaining this information within a trial would require lengthening the time to determine whether a vaccine works by 18 months \u2013something none of us want to see. Vaccines for other diseases offer a useful perspective about the inclusion of mild illness as a primary endpoint within a trial: data from other vaccines show that those capable of modifying outpatient/modest illnesses have almost universally been capable of modifying more severe illness. With most vaccines, efficacy in reducing the severe spectrum of a disease is actually somewhat higher than for mild aspects of a disease. \\nLet us hope that vaccination will easily produce discernible, measurable, medically important differences in COVID-19 disease in the populations enrolled in the trials. The current surge in activity in the U.S. clearly shows that we need vaccines to combat this epidemic.  \\n\\nAuthor\u2019s postscript:\\nAfter writing this piece, but before its posted publication, the press release of a 90% effective rate among persons with symptomatic disease was announced by Pfizer on Monday, November 9, 2020. While specific data are not available, attaining this milestone is a triumph for science and provides optimism that COVID-19 vaccines will be a major tool for curbing the medical, economic, and social aspects of this pandemic.\\n\\n*Dr. Larry Corey is an internationally renowned expert in virology, immunology, and vaccine development, and a major adviser to OWS.

This page explains how those changes result in differences between our site\u2019s calculations and some state estimates.\\n\\nIt is important to note that test positivity is a measure of testing capacity and while it can provide important context about case totals and trends, it is NOT a measure of how prevalent the virus is in communities. **Policy decisions, like openings and closings or interstate travel, should not be determined based on test positivity alone.**\\n\\n#### The State of U.S. Testing\\n\\n**In the U.S., there are no federal standards for reporting COVID-19 testing data.** This makes it impossible to offer a fully apples-to-apples view of testing data at the national level. Without federal standards, states have been left to forge their own paths, and as a result, they report testing data differently.  \\n\\n- Under the current conditions, inputs into the same data categories differ between states. For example, in one state, the data for the number of tests administered might include both antigen tests and PCR tests. In another state, the testing data might only include PCR tests. This means that while the data category (\u201cnumber of tests\u201d) is the same, the inputs and resulting calculation are different.  \\n \\n- Since the beginning of the pandemic, states have changed the amount and the type of testing data they report, and have been inconsistent in how they report antigen tests.  \\n\\n- Some states also periodically pause or fully stop sharing key data that are used in making positivity calculations, or change the cadence with which they report data. Both of these actions can create abnormal spikes in positivity rates in tracking efforts such as ours.  \\n\\nThese inconsistencies may result in a test positivity calculation on our site that is different from what states report.\\n\\n- We routinely review our data inputs and approach to ensure that our numbers reflect the most responsible public health calculation of test positivity.\\u2028\\n\\n\\n#### Different Approaches to Positivity Calculations\\n\\n[According to the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/resources/calculating-percent-positivity.html), and based on the testing data that states currently share, there are several possible ways to calculate test positivity. A state\u2019s positivity rate will be different depending on which approach is used. **Per the CDC, each of these approaches are valid, but they provide different insights into the impact and limitations of a state\u2019s testing efforts.**  \\n\\nWe believe it is important to look at both people-centered calculations and test-focused calculations, as each provides different information about a state\u2019s testing efforts. We have identified 4 possible ways to calculate positivity. Below, you can view the variation in states\u2019 positivity rates based on each of the approaches, and the wide discrepancies in the availability of data needed to make each of these calculations:\\n\\n- **Approach 1: Cases over People.** The number of __people who test positive__ with molecular (e.g., PCR) tests divided by the total __number of people tested__ with molecular tests.\\n\\n![__embed](testing_positivity_Positivity_P)\\n\\n- **Approach 2: Cases over People Tested in a Single Day.** The number of __people who test positive__ via molecular test divided by the number of __people tested with molecular tests, with multiple tests on the same person removed (also called \u201cTest Encounters\u201d)__, at different frequencies (i.e. days, weeks, etc.), depending on the state.\\n\\n![__embed](testing_positivity_Positivity_PE)\\n\\n- **Approach 3: Tests over Tests.** The number of __positive molecular test results divided by total molecular tests given__.\\n\\n![__embed](testing_positivity_Positivity_T)\\n\\n- **Approach 4: Cases over All Results.** The number of __people who test positive is divided__ by either __unique people, encounters, or tests__ (depending on availability \u2013 each variable can help indicate the number of people tested).  \\n\\n![__embed](testing_positivity)\\n\\n#### CRC Approach to Positivity Calculations\\n\\n**The Coronavirus Resource Center\u2019s current approach to calculating positivity throughout our site is Approach 4, for the following reasons:**  \\n\\n1. The lack of federal standards creates significant inconsistencies in how states report testing data. Currently, Approach 4 is the only one that can be used for all 50 states.\\n\\n2. Our data scientists and epidemiologists believe a people-centered calculation allows users to gauge whether states are casting a wide enough net with their testing to identify infections that may be occurring.  \\n\\n3. By looking at the percentage of people who test positive, we also can see whether there are testing participation, access, or capacity problems that need to be addressed.\\n \\nIt is worth noting that historically, Approach 4 focused more on the number of people tested as opposed to the number of tests given, and is the only people-centered calculation for which all states report the necessary data. We routinely monitor the data environment and make changes if necessary.\\n\\n#### Repeat Testing\\n\\nDepending on how states report data on the number of people tested (e.g., whether they deduplicate data for each person tested), calculating positivity using Approach 4 may not capture repeat tests performed on the same person.  \\n\\n**The CRC believes that as the pandemic has progressed and testing capacity has expanded, there are important public health reasons to conduct multiple tests on the same person.**\\n\\n- For example, someone who was exposed early in the pandemic may have a subsequent exposure and need to be retested.  \\n\\n- Additionally, states are increasingly conducting routine, repeat screening tests in high-risk populations, such as those in nursing homes.  \\n\\n**At the same time, including these repeat tests may obscure important trends and early warning signals.** For example, there is an increasing amount of screening testing being conducted within states for certain populations \u2013 such as colleges, universities, and large employers.This means that at one point in Washington D.C., tests performed by a major university represented approximately 20 percent of all tests conducted, which could skew the data for the District broadly.\\n\\n#### Conclusion\\n\\n**Despite the limitations outlined above, we believe it is important to continue to calculate and track each state\u2019s test positivity using Approach 4, which is a people-centered calculation, where possible.** We continue to make every effort to use the best data available and will continue to monitor the data environment and make changes as necessary.  \\n\\nTo explore this issue further, read [Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo\'s interview with The Baltimore Sun](https://www.baltimoresun.com/coronavirus/bs-md-hopkins-new-positivity-rate-20201023-jcmev6pxrfdulfmxk2iyhcw6ym-story.html).\\n\\n#### Data Sources: This initiative relies upon publicly available data from multiple sources.\\n\\n**States are not consistent in how and when they release and update their data, and some may even retroactively change the numbers they report. This can affect the percentages you see presented in these data visualizations. We are taking steps to account for these irregularities in how we present the information, but it is important to understand the full context behind these data.**","legacyIsNew":null,"isDrafted":null,"order":null,"date":"","attachments":[],"verticals":[],"authors":[]},{"id":31,"slug":"covid-19-vaccines-are-rolling-out-should-i-be-worried","meta":{"path":"/vaccines/blog/covid-19-vaccines-are-rolling-out-should-i-be-worried","title":"Covid-19 Vaccines Are Rolling Out.

This is a remarkable achievement, although much more needs to be done to get us to the other side of this pandemic. These vaccines \u2013 one developed and produced by BioNTech and Pfizer and the other by the National Institutes of Health and Moderna \u2013 are based on delivering messenger RNA (mRNA), which directs our muscle cells to produce the spike surface protein of SARS-CoV-2 and induce protective immune responses. While most Americans say they will get a Covid-19 vaccine, many say they are hesitant in part because of potential side effects, both known and unknown. Rumors and conspiracy theories about Covid-19 vaccines are circulating; here, we separate fact from fiction.\\n\\nWhat do we know so far about side effects of the mRNA vaccines? The best information comes from the large phase 3 trials that demonstrated the safety and efficacy of these vaccines and served as the basis for the Emergency Use Authorizations. The most common side effects of both vaccines are what is called reactogenicity. These are expected side effects and caused by local inflammation (redness and swelling) at the site of injection or more generalized reactions such as fever and muscle aches. Inflammatory reactions are part of the body\u2019s immune response to the vaccine, a sign that the vaccine is doing what is it designed to do. \\n\\nFor both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, these reactogenic side effects were mild to moderate, occurred up to two days after vaccination, and do not have any long-term consequences. For the Pfizer mRNA vaccine, the most common side effects were soreness or redness at the site of injection (84% of vaccine recipients), fatigue (63%), headache (55%), muscle pain (38%), chills (32%), joint pain (24%), and fever (14%). Severe adverse reactions \u2013 which include any severe disease after vaccination whether related to the vaccine or not \u2013 occurred in less than 5% of vaccine recipients and were more common after the second dose and less common in adults older than age 55. Most severe adverse reactions were not thought to be associated with the vaccine, with the possible exception of swollen lymph nodes, although this was quite rare (0.3% of vaccine recipients). Four vaccine recipients developed Bell\u2019s palsy, a paralysis of the facial nerve, but this was thought to be consistent with the expected rate of Bell\u2019s palsy in the general population. Side effects following receipt of the Moderna mRNA vaccine were similar to those reported for the Pfizer vaccine but with slightly different frequencies. The most common side effects were soreness or redness at the site of injection (92%), fatigue (69%), headache (63%), muscle pain (60%), joint pain (45%), and chills (43%). Severe adverse reactions occurred in less than 10% of vaccine recipients and also were more common after the second dose and less common in adults older than age 65. Most severe adverse reactions were not thought to be associated with the vaccine, again with the possible exception of swollen lymph nodes, although this too was quite rare (1.1% of vaccine recipients). Slightly more vaccine recipients (1.5%) developed an allergic reaction compared to placebo recipients (1.1%), although none were severe. Three vaccine recipients and one placebo recipient developed Bell\u2019s palsy.\\n\\nWhat about those allergic reactions? During the phase 3 trials, in which 18,858 people received the Pfizer mRNA vaccine and 15,180 people received the Moderna vaccine, no one developed a severe allergic reaction, what we call an anaphylactic reaction. Anaphylactic reactions most commonly occur in some people after exposure to certain foods such as shellfish, insect stings, medications, or latex. We first learned of anaphylactic reactions to the Pfizer mRNA vaccine after two healthcare workers in the United Kingdom developed such a reaction shortly after vaccination. Both had a history of having severe allergic reactions. Since then, several people in the United States have also had anaphylactic reactions to the mRNA vaccines. Fortunately, these reactions can be treated with epinephrine or corticosteroids. For this reason, the mRNA vaccines should only be administered in a setting capable of managing and treating anaphylactic reactions. We still do not know the exact cause of these reactions but some think it may be a reaction to the fatty coat that surrounds and protects the mRNA in the vaccine, specifically polyethylene glycol, a compound found in many products including skin creams and toothpaste and that has been associated with allergic reactions. People who have an immediate allergic reaction to the first vaccine dose should not receive additional doses of either mRNA Covid-19 vaccine.\\n\\nWe will learn much more about side effects associated with the mRNA vaccines as more people are vaccinated. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has set up a smartphone-based tool, called V-safe, that uses text messaging and web surveys to provide personalized health check-ins after vaccination and through which vaccine recipients can tell the CDC of any side effects they have experienced. There are still things to be learned. We still need to know more about adverse reactions that are rare or require longer follow-up to be detected, which will come with time and as more people are vaccinated. Although there is nothing to suggest this, we do not yet know if there is a risk of vaccine-enhanced disease, i.e., more severe Covid-19 in people who were previously vaccinated, particularly as immunity wanes over time. And importantly, we do not yet have sufficient information on vaccine safety in certain groups of people, including children younger than 16 years of age, pregnant and lactating women, and immunocompromised individuals. There is no reason to think Covid-19 vaccines will be less safe in these groups but more information is needed to be certain. We can be certain, however, that these vaccines do not alter our DNA, cause sterility, or infect one with SARS-CoV-2. These conspiracy theories are falsehoods that should not be believed.\\n\\nWe are fortunate to have at least two highly protective and safe vaccines against Covid-19. All vaccines have side effects, and the two mRNA vaccines for Covid-19 are no different. These side effects are similar to what people may experience after being vaccinated for flu or shingles. They may cause discomfort for a day or two but they can be managed easily and do not have long-term consequences. We cannot say the same for Covid-19.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Resources**\\n\\n[https://www.fda.gov/advisory-committees/advisory-committee-calendar/](https://www.fda.gov/advisory-committees/advisory-committee-calendar/)\\n\\n[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety.html)\\n\\n[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html)\\n\\n[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafe.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafe.html)\\n","legacyIsNew":null,"isDrafted":null,"order":null,"date":"01/05/21","attachments":[],"verticals":[],"authors":["william-moss"]},{"id":26,"slug":"band-of-brothers-and-sisters","meta":{"path":"/vaccines/blog/band-of-brothers-and-sisters","title":"A Band of Brothers\u2026and Sisters: A commentary on providing study vaccine to placebo recipients in the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccine trials","description":"COVID-19 VACCINE MATTERS: A blog series discussing the evolving science and policy of COVID-19 vaccines, led by internationally renowned experts in vaccine development, Dr. Larry Corey of the Univeristy of Washington, and Dr. Chris Beyrer of Johns Hopkins University.\\n\\n","image":"/images/assets/JHU-Blog-Brand-JHUUW-02_0c03ab0ec1.jpeg"},"section":"Vaccine Blogs","title":"A Band of Brothers\u2026and Sisters","subtitle":"","caption":"*The views and opinions expressed here are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the position of either Johns Hopkins University and Medicine or the University of Washington.*","content":"### A Band of Brothers\u2026and Sisters:  \\n### A commentary on providing study vaccine to placebo recipients in the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccine trials  \\n\\nKey points:  \\n- Some have argued that COVID-19 vaccine trial participants who received the placebo should not be vaccinated after the vaccine becomes available, in order to learn more about vaccine safety and the duration of protection.  \\n- But these questions can be answered through a different approach: a cross-over study design that includes vaccination of all study participants, even those who originally received the placebo.  \\n- With this proposed way forward, we can continue to learn about the efficacy and durability of the vaccine with the placebo group being vaccinated, and thus honor their service to us all.  \\n\\nOn December 2, the *New England Journal of Medicine* published an [article](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2033538) coauthored by many prominent medical scientists, including physicians, who advocated for keeping volunteers enrolled in the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 clinical trials on placebo, even after the vaccine becomes available under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), because there is \u201c[additional scientific information that can be learned](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2033538).\u201d As a physician and a scientist, I recognize no single clinical trial ever solves all the issues that need to be addressed for public health. However, in making decisions about when to offer a vaccine to placebo participants in a trial in which high efficacy has been demonstrated, one needs to carefully balance scientific interests with the benefits of vaccination to clinical trial participants themselves. We must consider the perception of fairness from both the individual and community levels.  \\n\\nSo, let\u2019s discuss these issues. First, let\u2019s look at what\u2019s to be learned from keeping people on placebo while the impending EUA and coming vaccine scarcity unfold. Both the Moderna and Pfizer studies have reached their goal. Enough information on the number of pre-defined cases of COVID-19 required to define the vaccines\u2019 efficacy has been reached, with the more than 150 cases of COVID-19 that were collected among trial participants. This occurred nearly two months earlier than projected, due to efficiently enrolling persons at high risk of infection, as well as the widespread epidemic of COVID-19 in essentially all regions of the U.S. The primary endpoints of asking whether the vaccine reduced symptomatic disease as well as the most important secondary endpoint of whether it reduced severe disease (hospitalization) were well defined \u2013 approximately 95% efficacy in the primary endpoint; 100% in the secondary \u2013 and remarkably similar between the Pfizer and Moderna clinical trials. The lower statistical bound of the Moderna trial was about 85% and similar data were obtained for the Pfizer vaccine. To date, the only reported death related to COVID-19 in the trials was in the Moderna trial and that was in the placebo group.  \\n\\nIt\u2019s hard to believe any more data are needed to show that the vaccines reduce the likelihood of developing moderate-to-severe COVID-19, and by keeping people on placebo we are only subjecting them to a higher risk of contracting severe COVID-19 disease. Are we now trying to show that hospitalization and/or mortality is only 90% rather than 100%? I doubt that.  \\n\\nEveryone wants to know whether the vaccine\u2019s protective effect is long-lasting and durable, and more time is required to understand that. But by the time January rolls around and more vaccine doses become available, we will have close to six months of data from the start of the clinical trials in late July. As I\u2019ll explain below, there is a very good way to assess durability of protection, including continued vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19, by vaccinating the placebo recipients in a crossover design that explores early versus late effects of vaccination. Thus, durability data can be obtained by vaccinating the placebo recipients rather than watching them acquire more COVID-19 disease during the trial.  \\n\\nUnderstandably, people want greater safety data. However, to assess the infrequent side effects of vaccination, it is not the cohort in the phase three trials (Pfizer 20,000 and Moderna 15,000) that will discern this; it will be from the cohort of millions of people who receive the vaccine under the EUA and are then closely followed post-vaccination. Respecting the thoughtfulness of the Guidance documents from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), regulators still want to know whether vaccination can result in enhanced COVID-19 disease and to compare this with the background rate of severe pulmonary infection in placebo recipients. So far, there is no evidence in either trial of severe pulmonary disease from vaccination. In fact, it is quite the converse.  \\n\\nBetween the two trials, there are between fifty and sixty cases of severe disease, and while the details of these cases are not known to me or the public (and such data are critical to unpack), it all says these cases of pneumonias with hypoxemia occurred in placebo recipients. Are we to be more worried about a body of data on enhanced disease from yet-to-be-seen vaccination as compared to exposing unvaccinated placebo recipients who self-identified as at-risk of COVID-19 infection to severe pulmonary disease? In the Moderna trial, 30 (16%) of the 187 reported cases were classified as severe over the four-month review period. Do we really want to see another 30 people get severe disease by watching them for four more months?  \\n\\nThe question in my mind is what scientific justification exists to not vaccinate placebo recipients who participated in a COVID-19 vaccine trial in which there was 95% efficacy and 100% effectiveness from hospitalization? One can reduce these numbers by saying only those at lowest risk \u2013 the healthy, so to speak \u2013 should be left alone and not vaccinated. The strategy of differential handling of placebo recipients is, however, problematic. To take placebo recipients who fall under the top priority categories \u2013 in other words, medical care or first-line workers, nursing home personnel, those who are elderly or essential workers \u2013 and provide the vaccine because they are in group 1 of the EUA in their state (or nationally) is logical. But to deny the vaccine to their peers who joined as clinical trial participants is quite problematic both from a social justice, fairness, and public perception point of view.   \\n\\nFirst, trial participants are essentially a community bonded together in a clinical trial; thirty to forty thousand people grouped together and under common scrutiny and rules. We in clinical trials authenticate this bonding by calling them a study cohort. In this medical vernacular, all are equal and each benefits from the other. The goal of the cohort is to achieve the study goal, which is not asking participants to get sick, but recognizing that in the course of human life some people will develop this disease. Within the common community of trial participants, did the endpoints of the trial come from the medical workers or the nonmedical workers? Was severe disease only in the elderly or in one group or the other? Does it matter? Does a medical worker who participated in the trial deserve vaccination more than the group of essential workers or someone who lived in the household of an essential worker who developed COVID-19 on the trial? Does either group feel good that the other is excluded when they entered the trial as equals in their own community? Differential access for trial participants inserts nonequity among this \u201cBand of Brothers and Sisters.\u201d Are they being asked what they want? If so, would participants say that they deserve the vaccine more than someone else in the trial? Did the medical worker who did not get infected sacrifice more than the bus driver who did or his friend who did not get infected? Need I say more?  \\n\\nThere are many dispassionate people who say we need \u2013 and have a societal obligation \u2013 to learn about the durability of the messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine\u2019s effectiveness. My colleagues at the CoVPN (COVID-19 Prevention Network) have, in fact, developed a proposal that would answer this quite effectively by vaccinating the placebo recipients, keeping the trial blinded, and following participants for signs of COVID-19 disease for the subsequent 18 months.  \\n\\nIn this scenario, the people who received vaccine in the first place would get their blood drawn and be randomized to placebo injection. And those who initially received placebo would get their blood drawn and be injected with vaccine. Let\u2019s say we start in early January with the first dose, by the end of January after the second dose has been administered, everyone in the trial(s) would be vaccinated. Some could have been vaccinated last July at the start of the trials, some not until January. We will be able to see the changes in the durability of protection in that six-month time difference, and *everyone in the trials would then be vaccinated and therefore protected*. My colleagues and I feel this is best done blinded, but that is perhaps a lesser issue. The key point is that receipt of the vaccine is intended for all and hopefully most will want to help answer this longer-term issue and continue to go to the clinic for COVID-19 testing and follow-up when they are ill.  \\n\\nWith this proposed way forward, we can continue to learn about the efficacy and durability of the vaccine with the placebo group being vaccinated. It is medically difficult to justify keeping people on placebo when we don\u2019t have absolute markers of risk. When we see that even some people ages 15 to 55 have been shown to experience severe disease, when we see increased hospitalization and death but have no clear marker of risk that can guide us as to who is at risk and who is not \u2013 keeping the vaccine from the very people who got us this far by participating in the trial, and who could benefit from it, is in my view, untenable. I, and almost all of the colleagues I surveyed who conducted these trials, honestly feel it is just not right.  \\n\\nLastly, some people might argue that by vaccinating those in the placebo group, we would be taking vaccine away from others who are more deserving or who might have a higher risk. This is not the case because vaccine doses labeled for research purposes are permanently labeled as such and are not those allocated to the general population. If we\u2019re going to adhere to the determinants of social justice; if we\u2019re going to advocate for the underserved; if we\u2019re going to declare the importance of altruism and act with principles of fairness, then we must treat all of the placebo recipients equally. They themselves have become their own Band of Brothers\u2026and Sisters, and we must honor their service to us all.

The basic requirements for an EUA are:  \\n\\n1. a public health threat exists; \\n2. there is reason to believe that the product will be effective in diagnosing, preventing, or treating the illness;  \\n3. the known or potential benefits outweigh the risks; and  \\n4. there are no adequate, approved, available alternatives.<sup>1</sup>  \\n  \\n**How did EUAs come to be? What was the first EUA?**  \\nThe authority to grant EUAs dates back to federal laws passed in 1938 and the Project BioShield Act of 2004, which was part of bioterrorism preparedness activities following 9/11. The first EUAs for the civilian population were granted in response to pandemic influenza in 2009, including an EUA for the use of oseltamivir (Tamiflu) in infants.<sup>2</sup>\\n\\n**Have EUAs been issued for products to treat or prevent COVID-19?**   \\nThe FDA has granted EUAs for a number of diagnostic tests for COVID-19, personal protective equipment, medical devices, drugs (e.g., remdesivir), and biological products (e.g., convalescent plasma).<sup>3</sup> \\n\\n**Have there been EUAs for vaccines before?**    \\nAn EUA was issued for anthrax vaccine in 2005.  If EUAs are granted for the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, these will be the first EUAs issued for vaccines for civilian populations.\\n\\n**Are there additional requirements for COVID-19 vaccine EUAs?**  \\nYes, the FDA released specific guidance in October 2020 on the EUA process for COVID-19 vaccines. The FDA specified a minimum vaccine efficacy of 50%, which is substantially exceed by both the Pfizer/BioNTech and the Moderna COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. In addition, the FDA specified a minimum period of safety follow-up before EUA submission, and that companies must provide plans for continued safety follow-up. The FDA also requires that vaccine companies provide data on the production of the vaccine, including the manufacturing process and quality controls, and the supply chain.<sup>4</sup> \\n\\n**What is the process for reviewing applications for COVID-19 vaccine EUAs?**  \\nApplications for both the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines were submitted to the FDA, which has had an opportunity to review and analyze the data provided by the companies. This information will be made publicly available. The Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC), an independent group of scientists, will review the data and make recommendations to the FDA about issuing EUAs for these vaccines. The Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) review of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine will occur on December 10th and of the Moderna vaccine on December 17th. These discussions will be live-streamed here and open to the public. \\n\\n**If an EUA is issued, is it the same as FDA approval? Does it mean that the vaccine trials end?**  \\nAn EUA is not a license. The vaccine trials will continue in order to learn as much as possible about the long-term safety and efficacy of the Covid-19 vaccines. This information could be used to support future applications to the FDA to license the vaccines.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<sup>1</sup> https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization  \\n<sup>2</sup> https://www.jhsph.edu/covid-19/articles/what-is-emergency-use-authorization.html  \\n<sup>3</sup> https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization#covidinvitrodev  \\n<sup>4</sup> https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/emergency-use-authorization-vaccines-prevent-covid-19  ","legacyIsNew":null,"isDrafted":null,"order":0,"date":"12/09/20","attachments":[],"verticals":[],"authors":["ruth-a-karron","jessica-e-atwell"]},{"id":33,"slug":"the-virus-s-gambit-the-vaccine-response","meta":{"path":"/vaccines/blog/the-virus-s-gambit-the-vaccine-response","title":"The Virus\u2019s Gambit; The Vaccine Response","description":"COVID-19 VACCINE MATTERS: A blog series discussing the evolving science and policy of COVID-19 vaccines, led by internationally renowned experts in vaccine development, Dr. Larry Corey of the Univeristy of Washington, and Dr. Chris Beyrer of Johns Hopkins University.","image":"/images/assets/JHU-Blog-Brand-JHUUW-02_0c03ab0ec1.jpeg"},"section":"Vaccine Blogs","title":"The Virus\u2019s Gambit; The Vaccine Response","subtitle":null,"caption":"*The views and opinions expressed here are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the position of either Johns Hopkins University and Medicine or the University of Washington.*","content":"- Some countries, including South Africa, have set up extensive genomic surveillance systems to understand how the SARS-CoV-2 virus is mutating.  \\n- Additional mutations will continue to be identified and we must be prepared to manage them within the broader effort to mitigate the pandemic.  \\n- As we learn more about the vaccines\u2019 efficacy against new variants, we must remember that the overall goal is to identify vaccines that reduce severe disease, as opposed to lessening more minor symptoms.  \\n\\nFor perhaps a month, we had the naivete to think that with the high efficacy of both the Moderna and Pfizer mRNA vaccines, we were ahead of this virus. Sitting pretty, so to speak: 95% effectiveness in overall disease and nearly 100% efficacy in preventing severe disease. We just needed to pump out vaccines and all would be well. This illusion \u2013 I\u2019ll now call it delusion \u2013 has abruptly ended. The bubble burst thanks to the scientific prowess of our South African colleagues, who had the foresight to set up a surveillance system in a very systematic, regionalized way to see how the virus was mutating. This is the way molecular epidemiology and pandemic control should be undertaken. They detected incredibly sudden changes in the virus\u2019s mutational pattern \u2013 not single changes, but multiple changes in several areas of the spike protein.  \\n\\nThese changes appeared in regions of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that we had not seen before. They are \u201cdangerous\u201d for our current vaccine strategies because the mutations occur in the same area of the virus that the Covid-19 vaccines train our immune system to look for: the spike protein that gives this novel coronavirus both its name and its distinct appearance. More specifically, these mutations are found in the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), which defines the part of the spike protein where the virus attaches to our own cells and to which neutralizing antibodies are directed. Some of these mutations looked like they might not be accessible or resistant to the neutralizing antibodies that arise after natural infection or even vaccination. And there were changes in another area we call N-terminal domain (NTD) that we don\u2019t really understand, but we know that some monoclonal antibodies \xac\u2013 shown to be among the most promised therapeutics developed to combat the virus \u2013 also likely work by binding to that region.  \\n\\nThe South Africans reported these changes to the United Kingdom (UK) because the predominant strain in South Africa in the early parts of the epidemic was similar to the one in the UK, something one would expect with the large international travel between the two countries. This led UK molecular biologists to look harder at strains circulating in their country. They then found a new variant that was starting to sweep across the country and create a second wave that we now see with increased rates of transmission and increased rates of hospitalization. This variant had one of the mutations in the RBD part of the genome, the one that appears associated with increased replication in the nose and transmission to other people, but fortunately not the changes that alter the neutralizing antibodies.  \\n\\nVery quickly, scientists put two and two together and saw two things were happening: 1) the virus was evolving more rapidly than previously detected, with mutations that enhanced both binding to human cells and virus replication; and 2) these two characteristics were being detected in the same virus. The UK variant had a change in just one area of the RBD gene that increased the ability of the virus to attach to its receptor in the human body. Scientists were finding that the UK variant replicates faster in cells and has a higher rate of replication in the nose and subsequent rate of transmission. We had seen that behavior back in June when we had a variation in the U.S. where the original strain from Wuhan was overtaken by what we call the D to G614 strain; that\u2019s what is mainly circulating in the U.S. This strain also increased attachment, but the F105Y mutation enhances these characteristics even more and the spread seems to be even greater. This UK strain is now called the B.1.1.7 strain, which has spread throughout Europe, and is being increasingly recognized in the U.S. The CDC predicts that this U.K. strain will be the predominant one in the U.S. over the next few months.  \\n\\nThe South African variant, now called B.1.351 also has the increased transmissibility gene of F105Y, but in addition to the U.K. variant has a couple of nasty mutations. One, called E484K, reduces the protection conferred by antibodies that most people have after contracting COVID-19 and that are also induced by vaccination. This mutation has been seen in other unrelated strains, so it seems to be a frequent way the virus tries to escape from people who have acquired immunity. This means that people who have been infected with prior strains and developed immunity to those prior strains appear to be at risk for the virus strains that have the mutations from South Africa. We call this \u201cescape from neutralization\u201d or \u201cadaptive immune escape\u201d from the virus\u2019s point of view. This is what RNA viruses do: influenza does this; HIV of course does this too.  \\n\\nIn retrospect, we were a bit na\xefve about SARS-CoV-2, thinking that because this subgroup of coronaviruses edits its mutations more efficiently, we might escape from having lots of different strains. But natural selection is very powerful, as Mr. Darwin taught us. What we have now is more people having SARS-CoV-2 infection than ever before on earth; it\u2019s ever increasing. And this is exacerbated by more interactions between people because we\u2019re tired of social distancing; and by more people with past infections who have antibodies, thus providing selective pressure for the virus to further mutate and escape our immune system\u2019s attack. So, we find ourselves in a situation where mathematically, this is not going to stop anytime soon.  \\n\\nWhat do we do about it? This week brought us data that says yes, we do need to manage this, but we don\u2019t have to panic. We do really have evidence that our current tools are going to be okay, but we have to create strategies to get us back up to the optimal state. And, there\u2019s a second important concept: vaccinating everyone globally is going to be necessary to stop the spread. What impacts one of us impacts all of us, including here in the U.S. Ongoing community spread anywhere with this virus means spread everywhere.  \\n\\nWe now have hard clinical evidence that our current vaccines will work as well against the UK variant as they have for the variants circulating in the U.S. The best evidence of this is a 14,500-person clinical trial of the Novavax vaccine which showed a 90% efficacy rate in a UK study where the UK variant constituted 30% to 40% of the strains circulating at the time of the trial. The antibody concentration from this 2-dose vaccine is pretty similar to what we saw in the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, and several groups have now shown that sera from people vaccinated with either of these vaccines also neutralize the UK B.1.1.7 isolate as well as the isolate from Wuhan. So, that\u2019s good news.  \\n\\nMore importantly, we got data from the Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccine trial out of South Africa just this past Friday. We were lucky. We didn\u2019t know when we conducted the J&J trial that there would be marked viral strain differences between South Africa and the U.S. In fact, when I worked with the company to design the trial, the reason we went to South America and South Africa for an international trial was because J&J is a global company and they wanted a globally developed vaccine. My network was already working with them on their experimental HIV vaccines and we had great investigators in both South Africa and South America who were tackling the COVID-19 epidemic and wanted to help in developing a vaccine. We were conducting so many trials in the U.S., we felt we could distribute some of the work internationally and everyone would benefit. At the time, we didn\u2019t realize how fortuitous this decision was. A month ago, after the South Africans noted that the B.1.351 variant was the main circulating strain in the country, we got nervous because South African scientists were reporting that the B.1.351 variant could not be neutralized by convalescent sera from persons infected with the earlier circulating strains of virus in South Africa. These data were confirmed by a number of U.S.-based laboratories.  \\n\\nFortunately, this anxiety was alleviated with the recent announcement of the data from the trial. The J&J vaccine protected against hospitalization and death in 88% of the enrollees in South Africa \u2013 that\u2019s 88%! Zero deaths in the vaccine group; six in the placebo group. Overall, the vaccine was 57% effective against moderate and severe disease. The efficacy number in the U.S. was 72%; in Brazil, 71%. So, yes, we do have an 18% to 20% difference in the effectiveness in the J&J vaccine. And I will add to that the Novavax vaccine, which showed 90% efficacy in the UK, showed 55% protection in South Africa. So, here too a reduction in efficacy to the South African variant using our current vaccines.  \\n\\nBut to put this all in perspective, we must ask ourselves: What\u2019s more important? Do we develop these vaccines to reduce the frequency and severity of us having sore throats and coughs? Or do we develop these vaccines to prevent us from getting hospitalized, or put on oxygen, put on a ventilator, or dying? I think all of us would take a vaccine that prevented us from dying, even though it might still mean a case of COVID-19 with a sore throat and a headache and some body aches for a couple days. I think I\u2019d take that deal. I could elaborate, but I think that\u2019s enough for one message. In my next blog, I\u2019ll talk more about the J&J vaccine and where it fits in the vaccine response in the U.S. and globally. We need a bit more data to become public before we tackle this task. There are lots of opinions here and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. But it\u2019s been a very good week. This past week has brought two new safe and effective vaccines \u2013 Novavax and J&J \u2013 into our world. That can be nothing but great news. As in all science, all good clinical trial outcomes lead to more good questions that we\u2019ll need to solve to control this pandemic.

Vaccination is what saves lives.  \\n\\n![Continuum of Vaccine Acceptance](/images/hesitancyigraph.png)  \\n\\n**What is vaccine hesitancy?**  \\nAttitudes toward vaccines fall on a continuum (*Figure 1*). While we have many effective and safe vaccines available, an increasing number of individuals can be classified as vaccine hesitant.<sup>3</sup> Individuals in this group may refuse some vaccines, agree to others, delay vaccines, or accept vaccines but are uncertain about this decision.<sup>4</sup> Vaccine refusal has been associated with increased risk of contracting vaccine-preventable disease,<sup>2</sup> and vaccine hesitancy is troubling because of its effects on herd immunity at the population level.<sup>5</sup>  \\n\\n**What is driving vaccine hesitancy?**  \\nVaccine uncertainty has led to more individuals questioning vaccines,<sup>6</sup> and delaying or refusing vaccines<sup>7</sup>; as the pandemic has increased uncertainty in many facets of our lives,<sup>8</sup> it has also led to high levels of Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy.<sup>9</sup> Determinants of vaccine hesitancy can be grouped into domains: contextual influences, individual and group influences including societal and peer norms, and vaccine-specific influences that are related to vaccine characteristics or the vaccination process.<sup>10</sup>  \\n\\nWithin the context of Covid-19, several drivers of vaccine hesitancy have been identified. Safety is the most pressing driver, including quality control and side effects, in part due to concerns related to the rapid development of vaccines.<sup>11</sup> Vaccine effectiveness is another factor.<sup>12</sup> Another issue is the sheer amount of misinformation, largely being disseminated via social media platforms.<sup>13</sup>  \\n\\nIn the U.S., the reasons for hesitancy vary across sub-groups; Black Americans are more likely to be hesitant than White Americans, rooted in historical trauma and fueled by mistrust of the healthcare system.<sup>14</sup> However, a substantial divide also exists along political lines, with Republicans more likely to be hesitant than Democrats.<sup>15</sup>  \\n\\nGlobally, vaccine hesitancy around Covid-19 vaccines varies widely between and within countries. A survey of 32 countries conducted in late 2020 found that 98% of respondents in Vietnam would definitely or probably be vaccinated once a Covid-19 vaccine was available, compared to just 38% of respondents in Serbia.<sup>16</sup> The reasons for hesitancy, however, remain the same: concerns about the speed of vaccine development and testing; concerns about novel vaccine technologies; and rampant misinformation.  \\n\\n**What can be done to build confidence and demand?**  \\nThere are many factors that affect vaccination decisions,<sup>17</sup> and individuals seek and are influenced by many sources.<sup>18</sup> As indicated in the Increasing Vaccination Model<sup>19</sup> (*Figure 2*), it is important to target and address attitudes, social processes, motivation, and access and other structural issues to nudge individuals toward vaccine acceptance.  \\n\\n![Increasing Vaccination Model](/images/vaxmodel.png)  \\n \\nThere are several evidence-based approaches to build confidence and demand:  \\n\\n**Avoid correcting misperceptions:** The instinctive response to vaccine-related misinformation is to provide correct information. However, this approach can backfire<sup>20</sup> \u2013 leading to something called the boomerang effect, which refers to a situation where a message generates the opposite attitude or behavior of what was intended.<sup>21</sup> Attempts to correct false claims about vaccines may be especially likely to be counterproductive.  \\n\\n**Pivot to focus on the disease:** Instead of providing correct information when presented with vaccine-related misinformation, focus on the disease itself.20 To effectively stimulate action, health care providers and public health practitioners must be able to communicate in a way that an individual perceives themselves at risk for disease (risk perception), believes there is an effective action (response efficacy), and has confidence (self-efficacy) that they are capable of taking that action.<sup>22</sup>  \\n\\n**Use presumptive communication:** The use of a presumptive format within a vaccine conversation is a promising approach in structuring the vaccine encounter.<sup>23</sup> This format linguistically presupposes that individuals will vaccinate, and therefore frames vaccination as the default, or normative behavior.<sup>19</sup>  \\n\\n**Utilize motivational interviewing:** Motivational interviewing is one communication strategy that has shown effectiveness in countering vaccine hesitancy and has been rigorously evaluated in clinical trials. Motivational interviewing focuses on leveraging an individual\u2019s intrinsic motivation for engaging or not engaging in certain health behaviors and uses tools such as active listening, reflections, open-ended questions, asking permission to provide additional information, and acknowledging autonomy as a means to strengthen the perception that the clinician and patient are working together toward a common goal.<sup>24</sup>  \\n\\n**Build trust through empathy:** It is important to listen to individuals who are uncertain about a vaccine decision. Although vaccines are recommended from a public health perspective, individuals who hold concerns must feel as though their concerns are being heard and that health care providers and public health practitioners are empathetic to concerns.<sup>25</sup> This is key to building trust and nudging those that may be vaccine hesitant toward vaccine acceptance.<sup>26</sup>  \\n\\n**Tailor communication efforts:** A nuanced form of communication that has shown some promise in mitigating hesitancy is tailoring. Tailoring includes matching each individual\u2019s specific beliefs, attitudes, and experiences to the messages or information they are provided, thus improving the personal relevance of the information, and the likelihood that it will change behavior.<sup>27</sup>  \\n\\n**Communicate often and transparently:** In addition to building trust through empathy, communication is also critical to building trust. Communication about a vaccine \u2013 including the vaccine development process, allocation and distribution, and safety and efficacy issues \u2013  should be frequent and transparent.<sup>28</sup> Proactive communication, even with incomplete information, is crucial.<sup>29</sup>  \\n\\nWe are currently living in an infodemic \u2013 there is an excessive amount of information available related to vaccines, and many consumers are struggling with identifying what is accurate to best meet the needs of their families\u2019 health.<sup>30</sup> Health care providers and public health practitioners must continue to develop clear, evidence-based, and practically implementable approaches to mitigate vaccine hesitancy and build trust in immunization.  \\n\\n---  \\n\\n**References**  \\n\\n1.

They would say things like, \u2018What\u2019s the big deal with measles?\u2019 Yet most people have never seen measles.  \\n- And the last one is the misperception about a link between vaccines and autism, which has been soundly refuted.  \\n\\n### What new reasons have emerged for mistrust related to the COVID-19 vaccines?\\t\\n\\nWe are dealing with a lot of hesitancy among communities of color specifically related to COVID-19 vaccines. With COVID-19 we have seen two new drivers.  \\n\\nThe first is the concern that the U.S. response and vaccine development process was politicized. Whether or not that is true, there is still a perception of politicization. Many believe everything about the vaccines is being done for political gain.  \\n\\nThe second driver of hesitancy is what we see whenever there is a new product on the market. It\u2019s a reluctance driven by the expedited process used to develop the vaccines. People want to wait and see how others react to it before deciding to get it. Not only are the COVID-19 vaccines new products but their development was expedited. That\u2019s a huge issue in why people say they don\u2019t trust it.  \\n\\nIn addition, many do not trust the health care system. Many do not trust their doctors. Many do not trust pharmaceutical companies.  \\n\\nAnd so all of these reasons come together to lead people to say they don\u2019t want to get the COVID vaccine.  \\n\\n### How can mistrust of vaccines be overcome? \\n\\nAs part of my work I\u2019ve been going to eight different African Methodist Episcopal (AME) churches in Baltimore to serve as the resource for people who have questions about the vaccines.  \\n\\nThe number one question I get is: Are the vaccines safe for Black people?  \\n\\nI explain how the clinical trial development process and recruitment works and how it was very different this time around with COVID-19, in that far more minorities were recruited to participate.  \\n\\nI also explain just how critical this issue is because communities of color have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19, meaning they\u2019re more likely to have severe cases and are more likely to die from it. It\u2019s even more paramount that these populations get the vaccines.  \\n\\nMany also ask how many African Americans participated in the vaccine trials. How many African Americans who were in the trials have comorbidities like diabetes and high blood pressure, so that they can truly trust the claims of the efficacy and safety.  \\n\\n### What can medical personnel do to overcome vaccine hesitancy with patients?  \\n\\nThere are several approaches that public health and medical professionals can use to increase vaccinations. We saw these work in a randomized controlled trial that sought to increase maternal immunizations.  \\n\\nThe first is to take a more culturally tailored approach such as matching patients with medical personnel who are the same gender and race.  \\n\\nThe second is to provide a shared decision-making process by using empathy to gain trust as opposed to a very biomedical model with doctors saying, \u2018This is what you need to do, now do it.\u2019 Instead, medical personnel need to really listen to the concerns of patients who have read a lot about vaccines on the internet and be empathetic with those concerns.  \\n\\nThe third is to use what we call \u2018nudges\u2019 or \u2018presumptive communications.\u2019 Rather than asking parents whether they want to schedule a necessary vaccination for their child during a visit, change that conversation slightly by telling them their child is due for a measles shot and we\u2019re getting it ready for them right now. That makes it the norm. That makes it the default that you would automatically accept vaccination. We tested that and found that it was really helpful.  \\n\\n### Do other nations experience vaccine hesitancy among their citizens?  \\n\\nI serve as the principal investigator on large grants that are mainly overseas in India, Afghanistan, and sub-Saharan Africa. They\u2019re all related to vaccine decision-making and hesitancy.  \\n\\nThe United States has a much longer history of vaccine hesitancy.  \\n\\nBut we are seeing it emerge more and more overseas, in sub-Saharan Africa and lower-to-middle-income countries. Part of that is fueled by misinformation that is communicated through social media. I\u2019ve been studying that extensively over the last year.  \\n\\n### What can social media companies do to help combat misinformation?  \\n\\nI received a follow-on to my grant to look at what social media approaches could be used to reduce vaccine hesitancy by minimizing people sharing misinformation about vaccines.  \\n \\nI\u2019ve been advising Facebook pro bono on its policies related to misinformation, related to how they label posts that could be untrue. We are working to help them be as vigilant as possible to make sure they are taking down misinformation that could lead people down the wrong path. One tactic Facebook uses is to display a pop-up when you\u2019re about to share something that could contain misinformation. Essentially when you hit share some Facebook algorithm flags the information and deploys a pop-up that says something like, \u2018It looks like you\u2019re going to share something that might not be true; please go here to double check.\u2019 And they\u2019ll include a link to the CDC or the World Health Organization. People can still share it. But at least Facebook is flagging this for them.  \\n\\nWe are also testing how we can get influencers in different countries to identify misinformation but also to reject it so they\u2019re not sharing it.  \\n","legacyIsNew":false,"isDrafted":null,"order":0,"date":"03/12/21","attachments":[],"verticals":[],"authors":["rupali-limaye"]},{"id":66,"slug":"covid-19-vaccine-doses-delivery-demand-and-data","meta":{"path":"/pandemic-data-initiative/news/covid-19-vaccine-doses-delivery-demand-and-data","title":"Q&A: COVID-19 Vaccine Doses, Delivery, Demand, and Data","description":"The Pandemic Data Initiative met with Dr. William Moss to discuss issues surrounding vaccination data, and how the United States can improve upon and leverage that data to more effectively contain the COVID-19 pandemic.","image":"/images/assets/PDI_WM_1_72f74f601d.jpg"},"section":"Expert Insight","title":"Q&A: COVID-19 Vaccine Doses, Delivery, Demand, and Data","subtitle":null,"caption":"The Pandemic Data Initiative met with Dr. William Moss to discuss issues surrounding vaccination data, and how the United States can improve upon and leverage that data to more effectively contain the COVID-19 pandemic.","content":"Comprehensive data on who is getting vaccinated in the United States is more critical now than ever, says Dr. William Moss, vaccinology lead for the Coronavirus Resource Center and executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. As U.S. vaccination rates fall, government officials need accurate data to target their outreach to the populations and communities still hesitant to get vaccinated, adds Moss.  \\n\\n### What has the United States done well with vaccine development and distribution so far, and what could be improved?  \\n\\nWe have several highly safe and effective vaccines just over a year into this pandemic, and that is really remarkable progress. I think the U.S. government deserves a lot of credit for the large investment it made in vaccine development. And we have made tremendous progress getting people vaccinated.  \\n\\nWhere I would give lower marks to the U.S. government was in the initial rollout. I don\u2019t think we were as prepared as we should have been when the vaccines were authorized for use by the FDA and recommended by the CDC in December. We weren\u2019t ready to hit the ground running with vaccine deployment. There were supply issues at that time. The U.S. government did not have the supply of vaccines that it anticipated in those early weeks after the emergency use authorization, but I think a lot more could have been done in preparation for a mass vaccination campaign.  \\n\\n### How does U.S. vaccination data compare with testing, positivity, hospitalization, and death data?  \\n\\nUnfortunately, U.S. vaccination data has faced many of the same deficiencies as other data streams that have been so important in tracking this pandemic and our response to it. \\n\\n> \u2018The fundamental problem is a lack of standardization in vaccine data collection and reporting across states\u2019  \\n\\nThere could and should have been stronger federal guidelines on the reporting of vaccination data.  \\n\\nI often talk about the Four D\u2019s to a successful mass vaccination campaign: *doses, delivery, demand, and data*. That data part is critical for understanding who\u2019s being vaccinated, who\u2019s not being vaccinated, and for monitoring vaccine safety. We have done better on the latter because there were existing systems to look for safety signals in vaccines. But we were deficient with reporting who is being vaccinated, in large part because of  the lack of standardization in data reporting across states.  \\n\\n### What important data are not being collected or released?  \\n\\nMany key demographic characteristics are not consistently reported in the vaccination data, including age, race and ethnicity, gender, and occupation. There were vaccine prioritization plans established by the states, but it\'s impossible to determine if those priority populations are being reached without collection of the correct data. Take older adults of different race and ethnicity: if you\u2019re not consistently collecting data on the ages of individuals being vaccinated or states are reporting different age categories, it\u2019s impossible to track the vaccination status of these highly susceptible groups.  \\n\\nWe know Black and brown communities in the United States were hit hard by the pandemic, and there may be more distrust for vaccinations in those communities. But states use different race and ethnicity categories and much data is missing, hindering our ability to track vaccinations in those demographics and to reach out with targeted vaccination efforts.  \\n\\n> \u2018If all of these data are not being captured in a standardized way, you don\u2019t know who you\u2019re vaccinating and you particularly don\u2019t know who you\u2019re missing.\u2019  \\n\\n### Can the federal government set rules for how states report demographics?  \\n\\nThe federal government certainly has the authority to set *guidelines*. The states are reporting to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the CDC is attempting to aggregate data across states. What was striking to me was when the CDC stated that nearly half of the data on who was being vaccinated did not include key demographic data, including race and ethnicity. The CDC issued guidelines, but I think they needed to be stronger, and the states needed to recognize the public health importance of data standardization. It should be a national priority to be consistent in how we\u2019re reporting data, so that we can look across states and aggregate data.  \\n\\n### How can data help to target unvaccinated individuals as vaccine supplies begin to outpace demand?  \\n\\nThe first step is understanding who you\u2019re not reaching. This is where having accurate and standardized data on who you are reaching allows you to better estimate who you\u2019re not reaching. Step two is to investigate the underlying reasons why people are not being vaccinated. I tend to put those people into two broad buckets. First, there are people who want to get vaccinated and have not been able to do so because of difficulties accessing vaccines. They live in remote rural areas, can\u2019t take time off from work, or lack computers and broadband to make online appointments.\\nThe other big bucket is of people who have access but choose not to be vaccinated for a variety of reasons, which is a complex phenomenon. They either do not trust the safety of vaccines or the medical establishment. Or they just want to wait and see. Data is critical to reach both groups of people.  \\n\\n> \u2018If you don\u2019t have the underlying data you can\u2019t devise the right solutions.\u2019  \\n\\n On the vaccine hesitancy side, you need to understand who those people are, where they live, and what their underlying reasons are for not getting vaccinated. With the right data, you cannot only design the right messages, but also determine the right messengers.  \\n\\n### As the pandemic overseas experiences a resurgence in certain countries, can we trust that international data are telling the whole story?  \\n\\nIt\u2019s a complex question. There\u2019s no doubt that some counts of cases and deaths are underreported. Some of that may be deliberate underreporting for political purposes, but some of that is forced underreporting because the systems aren\u2019t in place to do accurate reporting or sufficient testing in a country overwhelmed by cases, like India. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re missing many cases, not because they don\u2019t want to or are deliberately misdiagnosing cases, but they just don\u2019t have the capacity. If you think about it, the United States should have the premier public health systems in the world, and we have struggled with data collection, so you can imagine how other countries are faring. This will continue to be a critical data challenge in the coming months as the global vaccine roll-out moves forward.","legacyIsNew":false,"isDrafted":null,"order":39,"date":"05/26/21","attachments":["/images/assets/PDI_WM_1_72f74f601d.jpg"],"verticals":["pandemic-data-initiative"],"authors":["joshua-e-porterfield-ph-d"]},{"id":36,"slug":"when-will-children-and-adolescents-be-vaccinated-against-covid-19","meta":{"path":"/vaccines/blog/when-will-children-and-adolescents-be-vaccinated-against-covid-19","title":"When will children and adolescents be vaccinated against Covid-19?","description":"COVID-19 VACCINE MATTERS: A blog series discussing the evolving science and policy of COVID-19 vaccines, led by internationally renowned experts in vaccine development, Dr. Larry Corey of the Univeristy of Washington, and Dr. Chris Beyrer of Johns Hopkins University.","image":"/images/assets/JHU-Blog-Brand-JHUUW-02_0c03ab0ec1.jpeg"},"section":"Vaccine Blogs","title":"When will children and adolescents be vaccinated against Covid-19?","subtitle":null,"caption":"*The views and opinions expressed here are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the position of either Johns Hopkins University and Medicine or the University of Washington.*","content":"- Children are at much lower risk of severe Covid-19 than adults but some can get severely ill and have long-term complications.  \\n- Covid-19 vaccines are being studied in children as young as 12 years and will be evaluated in younger children over the coming year.  \\n- Safe and effective Covid-19 vaccines will help protect children, may protect the community at large, and will help us put the pandemic behind us.  \\n\\nChildren are not yet being vaccinated against Covid-19. Why? Although adults at highest risk of exposure and severe disease should be prioritized for vaccination, there are several reasons children and adolescents should also be vaccinated against Covid-19 when sufficient vaccine doses become available. First, although children and adolescents are much less likely to require hospitalization and die from Covid-19 compared to older adults, children can get seriously ill. More than 10,000 children have been hospitalized with Covid-19 in the United States and more than three hundred children have died. Of particular concern is a rare but serious complication of Covid-19 in children called Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). The precise cause of MIS-C is not yet known but it results in chronic inflammation that can itself lead to death or long-term complications. Second, older children and adolescents can be important transmitters of SARS-CoV-2 in communities, spreading the virus to parents, grandparents, and other adults. Although we need to learn more about the impact of Covid-19 vaccines on transmission of SARS-CoV-2, emerging evidence suggests vaccination is likely to reduce transmission. Children make up nearly one-quarter of the population in the United States and we may not be able to significantly reduce community transmission if children and adolescents are not vaccinated. Lastly, getting children back to school, team sports, band practice, and regular social events is a priority. Although schools can and should be opened with strict adherence to public health measures well before children are vaccinated \u2013 and teachers should be prioritized for vaccination \u2013 vaccinating children may be an additional way to reduce virus transmission in schools.  \\n\\nSo why are we not yet vaccinating children and adolescents? The Pfizer mRNA vaccine received Emergency Use Authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for people 16 years and older and the Moderna mRNA vaccine received authorization for persons 18 years and older based on participant eligibility in the large phase 3 trials. As is typical for clinical trials, studies are first done in adults. This was particularly important for Covid-19 as most of the severe disease and deaths were in older adults. Then, after the safety and efficacy of a vaccine are demonstrated in adults, additional studies are done in younger and younger groups of adolescents and children in a step-wise manner. These studies are frequently not as large as the studies in adults but are important to assess vaccine safety and immune responses in younger age groups. We now have a lot of data confirming the safety and efficacy of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines in older adolescents and adults but further studies are particularly important in very young children as their immune systems are still developing; the vaccine dose or schedule may need to be adjusted to be appropriate to their smaller body size and different metabolism. Vaccine side effects may also be different in children and we will need to know the impact of vaccination on MIS-C.  \\n\\nSo where are we in getting Covid-19 vaccines to children? While vaccine doses are in short supply, children are unlikely to be in a top priority group to receive the vaccine because they generally do not develop severe Covid-19. But progress is being made in evaluating Covid-19 vaccines in children. Pfizer has completed enrollment of 2,259 children and adolescents 12 to 15 years of age in its study of vaccine safety and immunogenicity that began in October 2020, and Moderna is enrolling up to 3,000 children and adolescents 12 to 17 years of age. Results of these studies should be available this summer, hopefully leading to Emergency Use Authorizations or full vaccine licensure for these age groups. However, additional studies will be needed in children younger than 12 years of age before Covid-19 vaccines will be available to them. It is important that these studies are done carefully and properly to ensure that the vaccines are safe and induce a good immune response in these younger children. Full results from these studies in younger children may not be ready until 2022. Several other vaccine manufacturers, including AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, and Novavax, also plan to evaluate their vaccines in children and adolescents but have not yet started enrolling in the United States.  \\n\\nBuilding trust and confidence in Covid-19 vaccines for children is critical as up to one third of parents in the United States have stated they do not plan to vaccinate their children, while others can\u2019t wait to have the vaccines for their children. Trials that evaluate these vaccines appropriately and show them to be safe and effective in children will go a long way in convincing more parents to vaccinate their kids when vaccines become available for them. Most importantly, this will help protect children, may protect the community at large, and will help us put the pandemic behind us.

COVID-19 Vaccine Regimens","subtitle":null,"caption":"*The views and opinions expressed here are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the position of either Johns Hopkins University and Medicine or the University of Washington.*","content":"- The effectiveness of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines is based on the results of clinical trials that gave two doses of vaccine 3 or 4 weeks apart.  \\n- The clinical trials did not give us information about different approaches to administering these vaccines (e.g., giving only one dose or spacing out the two doses beyond 3 or 4 weeks).  \\n- Until we have more research about their efficacy, we should plan to give these vaccines as two doses at the scheduled times 3 or 4 weeks apart.  \\n\\nIn this January of political crisis and surging COVID-19 cases and deaths, we are in the remarkably fortunate situation of having two safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines authorized for emergency use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. While the rollout has been frustratingly slow thus far, these vaccines and others under study hold our best promise of pandemic control. They are bright spots in an otherwise enormously difficult moment for our country and the world. Both products, the Pfizer-BioNTech and the Moderna vaccines, are based on novel mRNA technology, and both were shown to be highly effective in large clinical trials in preventing COVID-19 illness and severe COVID-19 disease. Both were studied as two-dose regimens. The Pfizer vaccine is given as two doses 21 days apart, and the Moderna vaccine is given as two doses 28 days apart. The two products work remarkably similarly as two-dose vaccines.  \\n\\nWith both vaccines, the goal was to be well above the antibody levels of persons who recovered from the natural SARS-CoV-2 infection. In other words, if we could immunize to antibody levels above natural immunity, we would consider the vaccines to be successful. The Phase I trials of these vaccines showed that it took two doses of mRNA to get above these natural levels. And this is the basis for the two dose regimens that were eventually tested, and shown to be so effective.  \\n\\nBoth scientific papers on the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines show results that say the vaccines seem to start working 10-12 days after the first dose. These trends, which show protection versus placebo, are extended out for the next four months, with increasing protection. The data after 21 days for the Pfizer vaccine or after 28 days for the Moderna vaccine, however, show the results of the second dose, since everyone in these trials received two doses. Whether high levels of prevention were achieved or sustained with just the first dose is unknown. The trials measured the efficacy of two doses, not one.  \\n\\nVaccine regimens are selected based on empirical studies of immune responses, first in animals, and then eventually, if the products pass safety and immune response tests, in human volunteers. Both the dose (how much of a vaccine is given) and the regimen (one, two, or three doses, and how far apart) are carefully selected based on these kinds of studies. Then, we go into the field with our best estimate of dose and regimen, and study how the vaccines work in real people with real exposures to the diseases we are trying to prevent. In the case of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, what we studied was two-dose regimens, spaced by 3 or 4 weeks. That is what we know from the data from the vaccine efficacy trials.  \\n\\nThough we are learning more about these products every day, as safety data continue to be gathered from the volunteers in the trials, as more and more people are immunized, and as we understand the \u2018real world\u2019 logistical challenges of using these products. But the pressure to get more people immunized is driving some decision-makers to move toward single-dose use of these products, or to stop withholding vaccines \u2013 as U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Azar announced this week \u2013 impacting the certainty of available second doses for all who have had their first doses. President-Elect Biden has also stated he would press for release of all available doses and no longer withhold vaccine for those second doses. Neither is suggesting that one dose is enough \u2013 but both approaches are gambling that product manufacturing will keep up with demand, and that by extension it would be acceptable to have some persons vaccinated with second doses after longer windows than the current FDA-approved 21 or 28 days.  \\n\\nTo be clear, the findings from the clinical trials in tens of thousands of volunteers is that these are two-dose regimens with quite tight time intervals between doses. Everything else is speculation. Until we have the empirical evidence to suggest it would not reduce safety or efficacy to make a change in the dosing and regimen, two spaced doses are what has shown such high efficacy in the trials. While there is great urgency to accelerate the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, and to immunize more Americans who want and need these vaccines, there are real risks to the effectiveness of these vaccines in changing anything about their current recommended and authorized use.  \\n\\nA corollary of the 2-dose response to the mRNA vaccines that is also increasingly being asked is how closely to 21 or 28 days does one need to be to give the second dose? The answer is another unknown, but in general, waiting for a boost is often associated with higher responses. So getting a boost at 2 months, while unproven, would compare well with other vaccine platforms and will likely be fine. The key issue with delaying the second vaccination is really how good and how long a first vaccination alone will work. That answer too is unknown and so getting the second vaccination is, from a policy point of view, imperative.  \\n\\nWith the AstraZeneca Oxford vaccine candidate, the trials in the U.S., UK and elsewhere have also studied two-dose regimens. This two-dose regimen was what the UK approved for Emergency Use Authorization of the AstraZeneca product in December 2020. But again, some decision-makers in the UK are now pressing for use of this vaccine as a single-dose vaccine, arguing that it will be more beneficial to immunize more people with one dose than a smaller number of people receiving full immunization. There is a purported balance of greater coverage of the vaccines versus full protection for fewer people. But this too is a problematic framing of the issues. We don\u2019t know that one dose is effective, or for how long. Having a large number of people partially protected, particularly during periods of high COVID-19 transmission, could end up benefiting variants of the viruses that can bypass the weak or partial protection from incomplete immunizations. The combination of partial protection and releasing of social distancing precautions could end up undermining the effort to control this pandemic. A decision of this gravity has to be made based on empirical data from human vaccine trials, not on modeling or other speculative approaches, and certainly not on political considerations or expediency.  \\n\\nThe current COVID-19 vaccines that we have developed so quickly are precious resources, and we must use them wisely and protect their efficacy. This calls for fidelity to the science, ongoing and rigorous research, and the great patience that COVID-19 has demanded of us all. We need to ramp up immunizations as quickly as is humanly possible, and we need to get many more vaccines into people\u2019s arms. But for a two-dose vaccine regimen, that means getting two doses, spaced apart as our data suggest, to ensure that people are truly protected.","legacyIsNew":false,"isDrafted":null,"order":0,"date":"01/15/21","attachments":[],"verticals":[],"authors":["chris-beyrer","larry-corey"]},{"id":35,"slug":"vaccination-plans-must-include-disability-community-needs","meta":{"path":"/vaccines/q-n-a/vaccination-plans-must-include-disability-community-needs","title":"Q&A: Vaccination Plans Must Include Disability Community\u2019s Needs","description":"The Johns Hopkins Disability Health Research Center recently launched the COVID-19 Vaccine Prioritization Dashboard to decipher how state policies have \u2013 and have not \u2013 prioritized the needs of people with disabilities in vaccination plans.","image":""},"section":"Vaccines Q & A","title":"Q&A: Vaccination Plans Must Include Disability Community\u2019s Needs","subtitle":null,"caption":"*The [Johns Hopkins Disability Health Research Center](https://disabilityhealth.jhu.edu/) recently launched the [COVID-19 Vaccine Prioritization Dashboard](https://disabilityhealth.jhu.edu/vaccine/) to decipher how state policies have \u2013 and have not \u2013 prioritized the needs of people with disabilities in vaccination plans. The website, created with the [Center for Dignity in Healthcare for People with Disabilities](https://centerfordignity.com/), interprets public information so that the disability community can understand the varying qualification rules and application processes.*","content":"### What barriers have people with disabilities encountered during the pandemic?  \\n\\n**Bonnielin Swenor**: Results from a qualitative study that is currently under review from the [Disability Health Research Center](https://disabilityhealth.jhu.edu/) show that the needs of people with disabilities have not factored into COVID-19 planning since the start of the pandemic.  \\n\\n**Sabrina Epstein**: For example, people who are blind or have low vision must use screen readers to navigate state websites to obtain information about vaccination eligibility and for making appointments. But most states are presenting that information in infographics that screen readers cannot read. Many vaccination and testing sites are drive-through only, and many people with disabilities can\u2019t drive for a variety of reasons. Several states require online registration for appointments, but not everyone is capable of navigating websites. People who are deaf or hard of hearing have had a difficult time at testing and vaccination sites where everyone is wearing masks but there are no interpreters or captioning tools to provide them service.  \\n\\t\\n### What data exist to document the lack of equity and inclusion of people with disabilities?  \\n\\n**Swenor**: There is limited disability data across many areas, a challenge that has existed long before the pandemic. This lack of data does not mean inequities do not exist. But these data gaps limit our ability to address inequities for the disability community. I launched the [Disability Health Research Center](https://disabilityhealth.jhu.edu/) at the end of 2019, in part to fill this gap in data. The Center is focused on providing evidence of the inequities facing the disability community in order to support policy and societal change. COVID only fast tracked that mission.  \\n\\n### In general, has the disability community been included in equity and inclusion discussions related to public health policies?  \\n\\n**Swenor**: When most people discuss equity and inclusion \u2013 and I am grateful we are having these discussions more broadly \u2013 they think of race, ethnicity, gender identity, and age. But disabilities almost never enter the equation in public health policies and beyond. It is a paradigm shift for people to look at disability through the lens of equity and inclusion. That\u2019s been our uphill battle. Until recently, we have not been at the tables where equity is being discussed. The [Disability Health Research Center](https://disabilityhealth.jhu.edu/) is working to change that during the pandemic and beyond.  \\n\\n**Epstein**: There\u2019s been a lot of discussion during the pandemic that young people will be okay if they get COVID because only old and sick people are dying. As a young person who is also a sick person with a rare genetic condition, it is invalidating to hear that. And it\u2019s a wake-up call to say we need to change the way people are devaluing the lives of people with disabilities.  \\n\\n### What was the genesis of the COVID-19 Vaccine Prioritization Dashboard?  \\n\\n**Epstein**: I was trying to register my grandfather, who lives in Texas, for his vaccine and I realized that I qualified for the vaccine in Texas. But I did not qualify for the vaccine where I live in Maryland, which was very strange and frustrating. That\u2019s when my public health brain began to wonder, \u2018Where else is this going on?\u2019 As I examined each state\u2019s vaccine prioritization plans, it became clear that they were all very disjointed. Each one defines high-risk chronic conditions differently. That makes it difficult to figure out if you qualify and to advocate for a better plan when it\u2019s not clear what other states are doing. It definitely came out of my own disability experience and having a disability community to turn to in order to learn that my experience was part of a larger problem.  \\n\\n### How do state vaccination rollout plans differ?  \\n\\n**Epstein**: What we noticed as we started going through all the state plans was that states were defining long-term settings in different ways. In some states, \u2018long-term settings\u2019 referred specifically to nursing homes while other congregate care group homes were grouped into different priority phases. As of the most recent weekly dashboard update, 27 states placed \u2018other types of congregate care settings\u2019 into a different phase than long-term care settings. States have also interpreted the CDC\u2019s definitions for chronic conditions in varying ways, which is why it is so important to not only show the phases but also define each condition for every state. Eight states, for example, are dividing chronic conditions across multiple phases. There is very little uniformity with how the states created a group called \u2018other disability-related group phase.\u2019  \\n\\n### How has the prioritization dashboard made information from the states more accessible for people with disabilities?  \\n\\n**Epstein**: The dashboard offers several different options. Options are key to accessibility because it\u2019s never one size fits all. The website itself is accessible by screen readers. But you can also download the data into a CSV, Excel spreadsheet, PDF, or print it out. There is also a Google sheet that is feeding the website all of the information, which then has additional accessibility.  \\n\\n### What impact has the prioritization dashboard had so far?  \\n\\n**Swenor**: The National Council on Disability cited the dashboard a day after we launched it in a letter to the National Governors Association. The letter used our data to demonstrate that 29 states have de-prioritized people of all ages with disabilities from early vaccination phases even though the CDC and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine have said their higher health risks should place them in the early rollouts.  \\n\\n*\\\\[The Feb. 9 letter from the National Council on Disability stated: \u201cWhile we recognize that in virtually all states the number of vaccines is limited, decisions as to who receives the vaccinations first must consider the most vulnerable in the disability community, as a matter of equity.\u201d\\\\]*  \\n\\nI\u2019ve never in my career seen something have such a fast impact. And it was an idea from Sabrina, a Johns Hopkins undergraduate. She is outstanding. To me, as someone who has a disability \u2013 I have a vision impairment \u2013 it illustrates the value of including people in research who are part of and understand the disability community.  \\n\\nI have hope for the future impact of this area of work, as we\u2019re beginning to see a shift at the federal level. The Biden-Harris administration appointed a disability advocate to the COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force and has included \u2018disability\u2019 in an executive order establishing a group to explore how federal datasets can best disaggregate information according to race, ethnicity, gender, and disability.  \\n\\n### Are there best practices that states could be following?  \\n\\n**Epstein**: We have not settled on any best practices so far because the prioritization process is just one piece of the bigger picture. Just because your group is prioritized doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you can get an appointment and get a vaccine in your arm. There are a lot of steps in between and a lot of barriers that people with disabilities face. Some states have de-prioritized people with disabilities and that is not a best practice.  \\n\\n**Swenor**: This data gives us some insight on which states are truly including the disability community in these decisions and which aren\u2019t. If we had to make one best practice: Don\u2019t make decisions about people with disabilities without including this community in the process and the discussions.\\n","legacyIsNew":false,"isDrafted":null,"order":0,"date":"02/19/21","attachments":[],"verticals":[],"authors":["sabrina-epstein","bonnielin-swenor"]},{"id":37,"slug":"vaccine-trials-forged-new-ground-in-speed-diversity-and-methods","meta":{"path":"/vaccines/q-n-a/vaccine-trials-forged-new-ground-in-speed-diversity-and-methods","title":"Q&A: Vaccine Trials Forged New Ground In Speed, Diversity And Methods","description":"The Center for Immunization Research at the Bloomberg School of Public Health reconfigured both of its adult vaccine study teams to focus on Phase 3 clinical research for COVID-19 vaccine candidates developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and AstraZeneca.

Brittany Feijoo answers common questions about the vaccine trials underway at the center.","content":"### What is your role in the vaccine research at the Center for Immunization Research?  \\nI am directly involved with the clinical trials for the Pfizer/BioNTech and AstraZeneca vaccines. My role as a Sub-Investigator is to evaluate volunteers during the trials.  \\n\\n### Are vaccines tested only on healthy volunteers?  \\nVaccines are first tested in a small number of healthy volunteers in Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies to determine safety and immune response. Phase 3 trials involve thousands of volunteers to test for safety and efficacy. In the COVID-19 Phase 3 vaccine trials, individuals with well controlled underlying medical conditions were also included. The purpose was to determine the effects of the vaccine in people representative of the general population. Some of the underlying medical conditions of participants included heart disease, obesity, diabetes, liver disease, and HIV. The trials enrolled an incredibly diverse pool of volunteers \u2013 in gender, age, underlying medical conditions, and demographics.  \\n\\n### Are vaccine volunteers representative of the population?  \\nGenerally speaking, most vaccine trials are made up of individuals of Caucasian background. We normally do not have a good representation of African Americans and Hispanics. This is largely due to the mistrust and distrust in research trials as a result of past occurrences such as The Tuskegee Syphilis Study. However, for the COVID-19 vaccine trials, there was a concentrated push and a goal of the federal government\u2019s [Operation Warp Speed](https://www.defense.gov/Explore/Spotlight/Coronavirus/Operation-Warp-Speed/) and the affiliated [Coronavirus Prevention Network](https://www.coronaviruspreventionnetwork.org/) to represent the general population. Vaccine research centers were able to recruit and enroll minority populations through national and local advertising as well as community engagement efforts. Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna enrolled approximately 10% African American volunteers and approximately 20% Hispanic/Latinx volunteers.  \\n\\n### Are there different types of COVID-19 vaccines?  \\nThere are numerous types or platforms of COVID-19 vaccines. The two leading platforms in the United States are the messenger RNA, or mRNA, and the viral vector vaccine.  \\n \\nThe mRNA vaccine, which includes the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, takes the RNA genetic material from the spike protein in the SARS-CoV-2 virus \u2013 which causes COVID-19 \u2013and encases it in a lipid nanoparticle. It needs to be encased because RNA is highly unstable and can degrade easily. This material is then inserted into the cytoplasm of a cell, not the nucleus. The nucleus is where DNA is made and people worry that an mRNA vaccine is going to change your DNA. It does not change your DNA. Once it\u2019s in your cytoplasm, your body starts to replicate the proteins. They then travel to your lymphatic system where your body recognizes it as a foreign invader and starts to generate antibodies. Your body will then have an understanding of what the antigen is, so if you get infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus you have the antibodies in reserve to fight it. The memory is there.  \\n\\nThe viral vector vaccine from AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson utilizes a method that has been used in previously licensed vaccines. It takes a part of the spike protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 and inserts it into a common cold virus. It is then inserted into your cells, which causes your body to produce antibodies against COVID-19. Oftentimes, people think it\u2019s more \u2018natural\u2019 because it contains actual viral protein and not genetic material like with the mRNA vaccine. However, both vaccine platforms are safe and do not change or alter your DNA.  \\n\\n### Will we have to get a COVID-19 vaccination each year like with seasonal flu?  \\nWe do not know how long the vaccines will provide protection against COVID-19. We do know that the coronavirus does not mutate as quickly as the flu. As of now, we do not think this will be a yearly vaccine, but we may need boosters from time to time. As a result, several of the vaccine sponsors are developing potential booster doses.  \\n\\n### Do these vaccines protect against COVID-19 variants?  \\nAlthough the percentages in efficacy may vary by vaccine, we are confident that all of the vaccines are effective against severe disease, hospitalization, and death. And from a public health standpoint that is crucial.  \\n\\nIs it possible to still get COVID-19 after vaccination? Yes, but most likely with mild symptoms or asymptomatic infection. This is why masking and physical distancing are still very important.  \\n \\n### Does receiving Emergency Use Authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration mean these vaccines are less safe?  \\nThe common concern is that the COVID-19 vaccines were developed too fast and that they do not have full approval. It is important to know that Emergency Use Authorization from the Food and Drug Administration does not mean safety was compromised. All of the same [safety protocols](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/vaccines/timeline)were followed as with other vaccine trials. It has been authorized for use because interim data analysis indicated that these vaccines were both safe and very efficacious. They each have been evaluated in over 30,000 participants. Pfizer had over 43,000 participants. And safety evaluations are still ongoing. Everyone in the trials is being followed for two years. When you get your vaccine you have the option of signing up for [V-safe](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafe.html), which is a way that the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafe.html) is tracking adverse events. You can download an app on your phone and report any symptoms. There is also the FDA\u2019s [Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System](https://vaers.hhs.gov/).  \\n\\n### If safety protocols were the same as for a typical vaccine, how were the COVID-19 vaccines developed so quickly?  \\nIt is remarkable how quickly the vaccines have been developed, but this occurred for several reasons. First, a large majority of the vaccine scientific community has been working on COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic. At our Center, we typically conduct Dengue, ETEC, RSV, Influenza, Ebola and Shigella vaccine trials but we all shifted focus to COVID-19. Second, scientists have been studying coronaviruses for a long time, including SARS-CoV-1 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) in 2003 and MERS (Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome) in 2012. Third, we had a large number of people willing to participate in these vaccine trials.  \\n\\nIt\u2019s been shocking to all of us in vaccine research that we were able to recruit so many thousands of volunteers. I often ask them why they participated and they say they \u2018had to do something\u2019 to help resolve the pandemic. Or they know someone who died or suffered from COVID-19 or they work in medicine or science and they understand the value of trials.  \\n\\nLastly, trials are very expensive. But the federal government\u2019s support has alleviated the delays associated with lack of funding.  \\n\\n### Who needs to be careful about getting the vaccines?  \\nCurrent safety reports have shown that some people who have had severe allergic reactions to polyethylene glycol, or PEG, could have an allergic reaction to the mRNA vaccine. Scientists believe the coating that encases the spike protein in the mRNA vaccine may be similar to PEG. The CDC recommends that these individuals not get one of the mRNA vaccines at this time. They recommend these individuals consult with an allergist-immunologist to determine if they can safely receive the vaccine.  \\n\\nThis also applies to individuals with allergic reactions to polysorbate, a similar substance to PEG. Any person who has had a severe or immediate allergic reaction after the first dose of an mRNA vaccine should not receive another dose. Individuals with severe allergic reactions to other vaccines or components can still get the mRNA vaccine but will be monitored for 30 minutes after vaccination.  \\n\\n### Can children receive a COVID-19 vaccine?  \\nCurrently, only the Pfizer vaccine is authorized for children, and it\u2019s only for ages 16 and older. The data have shown that children do not get as severely ill as adults do from COVID-19. But there is a concern for a condition called Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). Although it is rare, some children who have had COVID-19 develop inflammatory responses that affect different organs and tissues in their bodies, which can make them seriously ill. And this has been seen even in children who had COVID-19 but were asymptomatic.  \\n\\nOnce a safe and effective vaccine becomes available for children under the age of 16,  vaccinating this population is important. Especially to prevent MIS-C, which in the United States has been diagnosed more often in African American and Hispanic children. So far, Pfizer has evaluated the vaccine down to the age of 12 and plans to begin Phase 1 trials for children between the ages of 5 and 11 in the next few months.

He recently co-authored a piece for the Pandemic Data Initiative, describing how patient data has helped develop COVID-19 risk assessment tools for the intensive care units at Johns Hopkins hospitals. Please read the blog post [located here](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/pandemic-data-initiative/news/new-data-method-drives-hospital-care-for-covid-19-patients) for additional background on the severe disease risk calculators known as CIRC and SCARP.  \\n\\n### How has the development of COVID-19 risk calculators directly impacted patients?  \\n\\nOur job is to always make sure that we\'re doing right by the people we care for. These COVID-19 risk assessment tools let us inform patients and their families when there is a possibility they will end up in the ICU so we can make sure that we understand their goals and preferences in regards to treatment options. Sometimes people become sick before we are able to have those conversations, and we\'re left wondering if the patient would have chosen their treatment course. These risk assessment tools allow us to set expectations and discuss the patient\u2019s desires early while they are still able to participate in those discussions.  \\n\\nOne of the challenges though is that these tools do not inform treatment options to avoid severe outcomes, they just inform us that those outcomes are probable. We don\'t know definitively if a clinician should pursue more aggressive treatment options for a patient with a higher risk score, or if doing so would prevent ICU admission. Using a prediction model to trigger different behavior in a clinician is considered a medical device, requiring FDA approval. We did not have the opportunity to seek that type of FDA approval because the number of hospitalized cases has dropped dramatically in the last few months and there would not be sufficient patients for a comprehensive clinical trial.  \\n\\n### What will be the lasting effect of COVID-19 on hospital data?  \\n\\nThe challenges of COVID-19 as an acute hospitalized illness will slowly fade into the background, and no longer be all-consuming. My hope is that all the energy, time, resources, and bandwidth that have been put toward COVID-19 can now be applied towards other diseases, including the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) or long-haul COVID-19, as well as other diseases that we encounter every year like influenza and other types of lung infections.  \\n\\nBefore COVID-19 there weren\'t many tools that were available in the electronic health record (EHR) to provide assessment of risk, and this pandemic has highlighted ways in which we need to change data collection to feed that information into these prediction models. There are many data points in the EHR that are not discrete variables. Even something as simple as what symptoms a patient had when they got sick with COVID-19 is captured as free text, so I can\u2019t easily pull out how many of our 8,000 patients experienced a loss of smell for example.  \\n\\n> \u201cWe need to ensure that we are capturing information accurately and efficiently with all patients.\u201d  \\n\\nAdditionally, with the pace of informatics research around COVID-19 we\'re going to see a lot of health systems rethinking the way that they organize their data, particularly electronic health data. There need to be safeguards around it and ways to help people access the data and collaborate with each other, but COVID-19 has shown us that if we have the data organized in the right way, we can make discoveries pretty quickly.  \\n\\n### Is your research limited by access to highly detailed data from Johns Hopkins patients?  \\n\\nThe value of really rich and in-depth data sources, like the JH-CROWN registry, is that we can use that data to identify phenotypes and trajectories of patients, and develop complex prediction models. Once we know how to identify risk using our rich data set, we can use higher level information that would be in publicly available data sets, like age and obesity, to then validate our prediction models. We\'re starting to do that through a partnership with HCA Healthcare, the largest private provider of healthcare in the country. We have access to information from roughly 150,000 COVID-19 patients in their dataset compared to about 8,000 in our dataset.  \\n\\n### Why was the JH-CROWN registry developed in the first place?  \\n\\nEarly in the pandemic during a meeting, Antony Rosen, who is our Vice Dean of Research and director of inHealth, asked me about the relationship between an elevated D-dimer and getting put on a breathing machine. By that point I had seen too many patients to remember that relationship for each one, but he said I shouldn\'t have to remember and that we should have a COVID-19 data registry. We should have a team of scientists who can answer questions as soon as we think of them. We have to learn in real time so that we can take better care of patients who are coming down the pipeline.  \\n\\n> \u201cWe owe it to the patients we\'ve seen to learn from them to move things forward to the best of our ability.\u201d  \\n\\nAntony said he would provide resources, waive the fees of creating this registry, and set it up. We then had six months to show that we could make discoveries. It took us four of those six months to organize, wrangle, and structure the data, but since we did that it has been hugely successful. There are over 40 different IRBs that have been approved to use our JH-CROWN dataset, and our team has been involved in at least 20 publications related to COVID-19 that have used JH-CROWN data. ***We have shown that if we invest in the data architecture, integrity, structure, and accessibility, then we can be really productive in team science.***  \\n\\n### What has been your experience with the Johns Hopkins community throughout the pandemic?  \\n\\nMy specialty is not data, but organization and clinical perspective. There have been dozens of people who have been working on the data from the health informatics, information technology, biostatistics, and applied math and engineering sides. The COVID-19 Precision Medicine Center of Excellence and the JH-CROWN registry really reflect the work of hundreds of people.  \\n\\n> \u201cIt has been an incredibly collaborative team effort that has involved every single part of this institution.\u201d  \\n\\nIt truly has been an all-hands-on-deck experience from the frontline operations, to preparedness, to data analytics and research. We have been able to accomplish what we\'ve done for our COVID-19 patients because of the work of every single person at Hopkins, even if they haven\u2019t directly cared for a COVID-19 patient. It\'s very clear that everyone\'s supporting everybody else, and everyone has a role to play.","legacyIsNew":false,"isDrafted":null,"order":0,"date":"06/23/21","attachments":["/images/assets/PDI_JG_6_23_21_56263da956.jpg"],"verticals":["pandemic-data-initiative"],"authors":["joshua-e-porterfield-ph-d"]},{"id":39,"slug":"j-and-j-vaccine-finally-one-dose-with-no-controversy","meta":{"path":"/vaccines/blog/j-and-j-vaccine-finally-one-dose-with-no-controversy","title":"J&J Vaccine: Finally, One Dose with No Controversy","description":"COVID-19 VACCINE MATTERS: A blog series discussing the evolving science and policy of COVID-19 vaccines, led by internationally renowned experts in vaccine development, Dr. Larry Corey of the Univeristy of Washington, and Dr. Chris Beyrer of Johns Hopkins University.","image":"/images/assets/JHU-Blog-Brand-JHUUW-02_0c03ab0ec1.jpeg"},"section":"Vaccine Blogs","title":"J&J Vaccine: Finally, One Dose with No Controversy","subtitle":null,"caption":"*The views and opinions expressed here are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the position of either Johns Hopkins University and Medicine or the University of Washington.*","content":"- The J&J vaccine, which uses an adenovirus vector, has high efficacy against severe COVID-19 disease.  \\n- It is the only vaccine for which we have good clinical trial data about its effects on mild and severe disease from the South African variant.  \\n- The J&J vaccine is well-tolerated, with few side effects, and is easy to transport and distribute because it does not have extensive cold-chain requirements.  \\n\\nThis week brought data from another Operation Warp Speed-sponsored clinical trial to its analysis point: the ENSEMBLE Trial evaluating the Johnson & Johnson (J&J) Ad26 vaccine against COVID-19. This vaccine uses a different mechanism to replicate the coronavirus\u2019s spike protein in our cells and teach our immune systems to recognize the virus. Unlike Pfizer and Moderna\u2019s mRNA vaccines \u2013 which use a lipid particle encasing the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein \u2013 the J&J genetic recipe for the spike protein is carried into cells by a genetically engineered type 26 adenovirus, which has the SARS-CoV-2 spike gene encoded into it. What happens next is similar to mRNA vaccines: the spike protein is made, and our immune cells take it up and initiate the process of inducing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and T cells.  \\n\\nThe J&J vaccine has several different immunological characteristics than the mRNA vaccines, and SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels from a single dose are not nearly as high as those seen after two doses of either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines. But the T-cell responses to the J&J vaccine \u2013 what we call cell-mediated immune responses \u2013 are higher, especially in those we call killer T cells, or the CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, which seek out and destroy cells that are infected with the virus.  \\n\\nAnother important difference in the J&J vaccine trials is that they were designed through an international lens: J&J is a global company with high production capabilities, which eases the burden of distribution. The J&J vaccine doesn\u2019t have the cold-chain requirements of the two mRNA vaccines, and it\u2019s quite stable at refrigerator temperatures (4 degrees Celsius) for extended periods of time. J&J\u2019s Ad26 vaccine platform has also been used in Africa for preventing Ebola infections, in which the Ebola surface protein is placed into the Ad26 vector. Of note, the Ebola vaccine has been approved by the World Health Organization for preventing Ebola virus infections and has been widely administered to women of child-bearing age, pregnant women, and children. The Ad26 platform is also under investigation in elderly adults for RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) infections and in Africa and South America in preventive HIV vaccine candidates.  \\n\\nThe J&J clinical trial was conducted in the United States, Mexico, South America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Columbia, Peru), and South Africa. The trial enrolled approximately 44,000 persons, of whom 19,302 were in the U.S.; 479 in Mexico; 17,426 in South America; and 6,576 in South Africa.  \\n\\nThe initial analysis from the J&J trial data provided an extensive look at the vaccine\u2019s effects, as more than 400 cases of COVID-19 occurred in study participants. This large data set allowed for a good look at the vaccine\u2019s efficacy by country and region. Trial planning was done before the new variants were identified. Hence, it was fortuitous that within two months of identifying variants of concern, we \u201ccaught\u201d the wave of the introduction of these variants in Brazil and South Africa. Thus, we now have real-world data on vaccine efficacy against the B.1.351 variant, which was first identified in South Africa and has multiple mutations that may permit immune escape, using a COVID-19 vaccine designed with an earlier variant as the immunizing strain. The point estimates for mild-to-moderate disease showed some difference by region \u2013 after one dose, the point estimate was 72% in the U.S.; 71.5% in Brazil; and 57.3% in South Africa. This was far better than the point estimate of the AstraZeneca vaccine to the variant (10.1%).  \\n\\nFortunately, and importantly, for the J&J vaccine the efficacy against severe COVID-19 disease was high in all countries. In the United States, there was only 1 case of severe disease in the vaccine group, and 7 in placebo. For South Africa, it was 4 in the vaccine group, 22 in placebo; for Columbia, 1 in the vaccine group, 11 in placebo; and in Brazil, 1 in vaccine, 8 for placebo. So, in this one trial, the J&J one-dose vaccine offered anywhere from 82% to 90% protection against severe disease. The 6 deaths from COVID-19 in South Africa were all in the placebo group.  \\n\\nFor a one-dose vaccine, these data are better than I initially expected. To illustrate this, I\u2019ll include a [link](https://www.fda.gov/advisory-committees/advisory-committee-calendar/vaccines-and-related-biological-products-advisory-committee-february-26-2021-meeting-announcement#event-materials) to materials that nicely demonstrate the J&J vaccine\u2019s efficacy on moderate-to-severe disease in South Africa and on severe COVID-19 disease for the entire study.  \\n\\nThe ENSEMBLE study outlines the complex nature of the human immune response to vaccination and the subsequent outcome. The antibody levels with the one-dose J&J vaccine are much lower than what we see with the mRNA vaccines and yet the J&J vaccine\u2019s effectiveness against preventing severe disease \u2013 particularly against the B.1.351 South African variant \u2013 is quite similar. Why? What components of the immune response are central to this protection from severe disease? Antibodies? T cells? Both? These are issues we must decipher, and many of us expect that having good CD8+ T cells to the virus is an important function of the vaccine\u2019s excellent prevention against severe disease. It is a nice scientific problem to have, how to go from 85% to 100% efficacy.  \\n\\nThe question in front of us today is how do we use this vaccine in the U.S. and globally? It is, to date, the only vaccine for which we have good clinical data about both its effects in mild disease as well as severe disease with the South African variant, the cause for recent concern worldwide. The data from the two mRNA vaccines suggest that they are able to effectively handle the other emerging B.1.1.7 and California 20.C variants in the U.S. It is, however, the South African variant that we are most concerned about with respect to all the vaccine platforms in our current portfolio. As I mentioned earlier, the South African variant is one in which the two-dose AstraZeneca vaccine (chimpanzee adenovirus-based vector) showed no effectiveness in reducing even mild-to-moderate disease in young, healthy South Africans. The point prevalence was 10% with the two-dose AstraZeneca vaccine versus 59% in the one-dose J&J vaccine. These data, announced within a week, resulted in the South African government \u2013 which had purchased and had in-country more than a million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine \u2013 to alter its rollout plan for use in health care workers and work with J&J instead to obtain its vaccine in an expanded access program. This dynamic interaction between clinical trial data and health care policy is what all these trials have been about.  \\n\\nThe J&J vaccine is an extremely well-tolerated vaccine: fewer than 0.5% of enrollees had any severe (grade 3) side effects. It is easy to transport and distribute without strict cold-chain requirements and, as mentioned, we have extensive clinical experience with the Ad26 vaccine platform in pregnant women and children. Even though there is somewhat less efficacy with the J&J vaccine in preventing mild illness \u2013 such as a cough, fever, headache, or sore throat \u2013 than with the mRNA vaccines, the data from the J&J trial show that the *severity of illness* is significantly less after vaccination. I am gratified to see that both the FDA and CDC ACIP (Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices) advisors endorsed use of this vaccine for those 18 years of age and older. We hope and are pushing J&J to conduct its pediatric trials expeditiously so the advantages of a one-dose vaccine can be used to help get children immunized and back to school by the fall term.  \\n\\nCombating this outbreak requires achieving high vaccine coverage. Vaccination will also reduce the likelihood of more variants circulating. For all of these reasons, once we start to see 100 million doses of the J&J vaccine in circulation in the coming weeks and months, the data support widespread use of this vaccine in the U.S.","legacyIsNew":false,"isDrafted":null,"order":0,"date":"03/02/21","attachments":[],"verticals":[],"authors":["larry-corey"]},{"id":38,"slug":"experts-explore-the-ethics-of-covid-19-vaccines-and-pregnancy","meta":{"path":"/vaccines/report/experts-explore-the-ethics-of-covid-19-vaccines-and-pregnancy","title":"Experts Explore the Ethics of Covid-19 Vaccines and Pregnancy","description":"Globally, over 200 million people are pregnant each year.

Whether pregnant people should seek vaccination is a deeply personal decision.","content":"### Are pregnant people at higher risk of developing severe Covid-19?  \\nEvidence to date suggests that people who are pregnant face a higher risk of severe disease and death from Covid-19 infection compared to people who are not pregnant. For instance, pregnant people are [three times more likely](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6944e3.htm) to require admission to intensive care and to need invasive ventilation. The overall risk of death among pregnant people is low, but it is elevated compared to similar people who are not pregnant. [Some studies](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6944e2.htm) suggest that Covid-19 in pregnancy might be associated with increased rates of preterm birth.  \\n\\nOur understanding of the probability and severity of harms from SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy is evolving. The pandemic has been ongoing for just over a year, which limits what can currently be known about the health risks of Covid-19 disease for pregnant people, and especially their offspring. Whether SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy poses risks to the developing fetus remains underdetermined. Current evidence suggests that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to the fetus is rare. However, severe maternal illness can have serious implications for the fetus. For example, fevers during early pregnancy have in some studies been associated with increased risk for certain birth defects. Since the pandemic has only been with us for just over a year, there are no data yet on long-term childhood outcomes for offspring exposed in utero.  \\n\\nThere are still significant unknowns: How do risks vary by trimester? What are the risks of asymptomatic infection? Further, most current information about Covid-19 disease and pregnancy comes from high-income countries, limiting its global generalizability.  \\n\\n### Do we know if Covid-19 vaccines are safe in pregnancy?  \\nAt this point, tens of thousands of pregnant people have received COVID-19 vaccines globally, including in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., and Israel. Thus far, there have been no reports suggestive of concern. Additionally, none of the vaccines that have thus far been authorized for use in the U.S. \u2013 the Pfizer-BioNtech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson/Janssen vaccines, as well as the AstraZeneca vaccine authorized in other countries \u2013 contain live or replication competent viruses. Therefore, it is extremely unlikely that a vaccine virus could replicate, cross the placenta, and infect the fetus. However, more research is needed in order to better characterize the safety profile of each Covid-19 vaccine in pregnancy.  \\n\\nAlthough there is not yet pregnancy-specific data about Covid-19 vaccines from clinical trials, the vaccines have been studied in pregnant laboratory animals. Called developmental and reproductive toxicity (DART) studies, research with pregnant animals can provide reassurance about moving forward with vaccine research in pregnant people. There are no concerning signals from DART study data for the Pfizer BioNtech, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson/Janssen, and AstraZeneca vaccines. Small numbers of participants in the research trials for these vaccines have become pregnant. No concerning risk signals in those pregnancies have been reported.  \\n\\nAll three of these vaccines offer a very high level of protection against serious Covid-19 disease. There is little reason to believe these vaccines will be less effective in pregnant people than they are in people of comparable age who are not pregnant.  \\n\\n### What positions have different national and global authorities taken on pregnant people and Covid-19 vaccines that are authorized for use?\\nThe absence of pregnancy-specific data for Covid-19 vaccines has made regulatory and public health decision-making complicated. Largely due to the absence of evidence, most public health agencies have held back on making explicit recommendations on Covid-19 vaccine administration in pregnancy. In the U.S., Canada, the UK, and several other countries, the position of the relevant public health authority is that pregnant people who otherwise qualify for authorized vaccine \u2013 such as pregnant people who are health care workers or members of other prioritized essential workforces \u2013 should be permitted to make their own decisions about vaccination, based on their assessment of whether the prospect of benefit to them and their offspring outweighs the risks. This is also [the position of the World Health Organization (WHO)](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/338484/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-BNT162b2-2021.1-eng.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) for the vaccines they have thus far evaluated. In Israel, the Ministry of Health and Vaccines Prioritization Committee recommended vaccination for pregnant people in their second or third trimester. Some jurisdictions in the U.S. are already offering the vaccine to pregnant people given higher Covid-19 risk in pregnancy, including the District of Columbia, Pennsylvania, and Mississippi.  \\n\\n### What do obstetricians say about Covid-19 vaccines and pregnancy?  \\nProfessional societies, such as the [American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)](https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-advisory/articles/2020/12/vaccinating-pregnant-and-lactating-patients-against-covid-19), [the Society for Maternal-Fetal-Medicine (SMFM)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.smfm.org/media/2632/FDA_final.pdf), and the [Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG)](https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/news/updated-advice-on-covid-19-vaccination-in-pregnancy-and-women-who-are-breastfeeding/) all support Covid-19 vaccination in pregnancy when the benefits outweigh the risks.  \\n\\n### How should pregnant people think about the benefits and risks?  \\nThe major benefit of the Pfizer BioNtech, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson/Janssen, and AstraZeneca vaccines to all people, pregnant or not, is that being vaccinated provides a high level of protection against serious Covid-19 disease.  \\n\\nHow important the protective benefit of Covid-19 vaccination is to any individual pregnant person depends on how likely they are to get infected, and how likely they are to get seriously ill, if infected. Pregnant people differ in how likely they are to get infected. A person\u2019s risk of becoming infected depends on at least three things: 1) whether their job puts them at risk of infection; 2) the rate of transmission in their community; and 3) who they live with, especially whether they live with people who are at increased risk because of their jobs, or in a crowded home or densely populated neighborhood. For example, people whose jobs require them to be in regular contact with many people are at higher risk of infection than people who can work from home. Similarly, people who live with other people who also work outside the home are at greater risk than people who live alone or only with others who also work or attend school from home.  \\n\\nPregnant people also differ in how likely they are to get seriously ill with Covid-19 disease, if they become infected. While pregnancy by itself is a risk factor for serious illness, some medical conditions like diabetes, heart disease, or being very overweight are even greater risk factors. People who are pregnant and also have high-risk medical conditions are more likely to develop severe Covid-19 illness if they become infected than pregnant people who do not have relevant medical conditions.  \\n\\nPregnant people should also consider whether they have access to alternative modes of protection from infection. Questions to ask include: can they take a leave from work or be temporarily transferred to a lower-risk job; do they have access to high quality personal protective equipment; and, if someone in their household gets infected or exposed, is there a way for that person to safely isolate away from others? \\n\\nResources, including [provider information sheets](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.smfm.org/media/2656/Provider_Considerations_for_Engaging_in_COVID_Vaccination_Considerations_12-21-20_(final).pdf), [conversation guides](https://www.acog.org/covid-19/covid-19-vaccines-and-pregnancy-conversation-guide-for-clinicians), and [decision aids](https://www.baystatehealth.org/-/media/files/covid19/vaccine-info-for-pregnant-people-updated-12-28.pdf?la=en), have been developed to facilitate the values-driven and context-dependent calculations that pregnant people face in the coming months. \\n\\n### When are we likely to get data from pregnant people?  \\nSome people prioritized for vaccination have received Covid-19 vaccines while pregnant, and data about their pregnancies are being collected by public health agencies. Registries are being established in multiple countries to capture the experiences of pregnant people who are receiving Covid-19 vaccines. At least one company, Pfizer BioNTech, has begun a pregnancy-specific trial for their vaccine, which will enroll 4000 pregnant people across nine countries.\\n\\n### What is wrong with this picture?\\nThe absence of pregnancy-specific data around Covid-19 vaccines continues an [unfair pattern in which evidence about safety of new vaccines for pregnant people lags behind](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/574503059f72665be88193e9/t/5c082429c2241ba2553ee1f5/1544037418944/PREVENT-Web.pdf). This unfairness is ethically problematic in at least two important ways.\\n\\nFirst, people may be denied vaccine, or may face barriers in accessing vaccine, because they are pregnant. Public health agencies globally have struggled to determine the most ethical position regarding whether to allow pregnant people to receive Covid-19 vaccines in the absence of pregnancy-specific data. While there is still limited evidence on the safety of currently authorized vaccines in pregnancy, with high vaccine efficacy, no risk signals from studies in pregnant animals, and few biologically plausible risks, the permissive approach that most health authorities have taken enabling individuals to decide for themselves is ethically appropriate. However, in some settings \u2013 whether by policy guidance, local guidelines, or even individual provider reticence \u2013 a lack of evidence may mean that pregnant people will face unfair denial of highly effective vaccines from which they stand to benefit.\\n \\nSecond, even when pregnant people are eligible for vaccination, because public health authorities have not explicitly recommended Covid-19 vaccines in pregnancy, the burden of making decisions about vaccination has shifted to pregnant people. Evidence gaps shift the responsibility for associated risk more squarely to pregnant people, where their non-pregnant peers have an evidence base and a public health recommendation to back up their vaccination decision. While endorsement from medical professional societies is helpful, without pregnancy-specific evidence or explicit pregnancy recommendations, there is also the risk that pregnant people\u2019s decisions will be biased by [the strong risk distortions that are known to be present in the context of pregnancy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3640505/). \\n\\nHopefully, the evidence necessary for public health agencies to make clear, full-throated recommendations about the use of at least some Covid-19 vaccines in pregnancy will be forthcoming in the coming months. Efforts are underway to encourage developers of vaccines not yet approved for use to move more quickly to conduct studies with pregnant people and otherwise undertake efforts to systematically generate evidence on the safety of their products in pregnancy. We will continue to update this brief, as new data and new policies become available, both for the vaccines discussed here and for additional vaccines that will shortly be evaluated for use in public health programs.  \\n","legacyIsNew":false,"isDrafted":null,"order":0,"date":"03/01/21","attachments":[],"verticals":[],"authors":["elana-jaffe","ruth-faden","carleigh-krubiner","chizoba-wonodi"]},{"id":41,"slug":"vaccination-transmission-and-masks","meta":{"path":"/vaccines/blog/vaccination-transmission-and-masks","title":"Vaccination, Transmission, and Masks","description":"COVID-19 VACCINE MATTERS: A blog series discussing the evolving science and policy of COVID-19 vaccines, led by internationally renowned experts in vaccine development, Dr. Larry Corey of the Univeristy of Washington, and Dr. Chris Beyrer of Johns Hopkins University.","image":"/images/assets/JHU-Blog-Brand-JHUUW-02_0c03ab0ec1.jpeg"},"section":"Vaccine Blogs","title":"Vaccination, Transmission, and Masks","subtitle":null,"caption":"*The views and opinions expressed here are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the position of either Johns Hopkins University and Medicine or the University of Washington.*","content":"- We do not yet know whether individuals who are fully vaccinated can transmit SARS-CoV-2 to other individuals, although the risk is almost certainly lower than for unvaccinated persons  \\n- To limit transmission as much as possible, mask wearing remains critical, even for those who are fully vaccinated until community transmission decreases to low levels and a high proportion of people are vaccinated  \\n- Studies to better understand the potential for transmission by those who are fully vaccinated are underway, but they will take time to complete  \\n\\nProbably the biggest public health policy issue facing us today \u2013 and an issue each one of us will have to consider as the U.S. mass vaccination campaign continues to roll out \u2013 is what to do about wearing a mask once you\u2019re fully vaccinated while many around you are not? No one likes masks, including me. But I understand how many gazillion viral particles can be put on the head of a pin and how many gazillion viral particles can be emitted through a sneeze, or while talking, or eating. And I understand how evolution has made this the mode of transmission for hundreds and hundreds of viruses \u2013 far too numerous to list here; these little critters were here on the planet well before us and pass from human to human without recrimination.  \\n\\nThe good news for us in the fight against COVID-19 is that we now have three very effective vaccines \u2013 two mRNA (Pfizer and Moderna), and one Ad26 (Johnson & Johnson) \u2013 approved in the U.S. under Emergency Use Authorization that provide personal protection against symptomatic COVID-19, and millions of Americans have now been fully immunized. But what about those unvaccinated persons around you? Are they protected? Can you still acquire the virus unknowingly and transmit it? The CDC put out new guidance on social distancing for fully immunized people on Monday, March 8th.  We need to think about this [new guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html) and what we know and don\u2019t know about SARS-CoV-2 transmission.  \\n\\nFirst, let\u2019s look at what happens when you come into contact with the virus and how protection works in your body.  \\n\\nWhen the virus lands on your hands and you touch your eyes or your nose or your mouth, it really becomes a race between your immune response and the virus\u2019s ability to invade cells and start replicating. That race differs, depending on the virus, the inoculation load, the strain of the virus, and your own immune response. How good are the first immune system \u201csoldiers,\u201d often not primed by vaccination; how quick are the second line of soldiers \u2013 do they get into the nose, and how many get into the nose? There\u2019s a fair amount of work that\u2019s been done on what we call the battlefield between the host and the virus. And for many fast-replicating viruses, the half-life of a viral-infected cell is 20 to 40 minutes. So, every twenty-minute delay in an immune response can lead to a doubling, sometimes a tripling of the virus. This interplay tends to happen in what I\u2019ll call staccato time; it certainly is not adagio.  \\n\\nBut once you\u2019re vaccinated, you are protected from getting severely ill or dying. What we don\u2019t yet know is: can the virus still infect you and replicate at high enough levels that you could unwittingly transmit it to someone else? That\u2019s the question we\u2019re asking today. If the person is vaccinated, this may not be a big deal. But if they\u2019re not vaccinated and they have an underlying medical condition, then we could have a problem. A problem that leads to hospitalization or worse, death.  \\n\\nThe potential severity of COVID-19 continues to stagger the imagination. Data collected over the past year grimly prove that early assertions calling COVID-19 simply the flu were false. A graph  recently shown in the *New York Times* illustrates my point:\\n\\n![The New York Times Graph: Flu and COVID-19 deaths]()  \\n \\nIt\u2019s *this* knowledge that I carry with me from day to day as a reminder: \u201cLarry, you\u2019re vaccinated, but a lot of people aren\u2019t. In fact, 90% of the people walking around are not vaccinated and you do not have the luxury to give up your responsibility to protect them.\u201d  \\n\\nSo, this issue of mask wearing? Once you\u2019re vaccinated, it\u2019s really not about you at all. It\u2019s about the other person. Maybe a friend or family member or neighbor or colleague that attends the same event or gathering but has not had the opportunity to be vaccinated. Or even someone who has chosen not to be vaccinated: do they deserve to get ill?  \\n\\nOne might ask, a year into this pandemic, why don\u2019t we know whether being vaccinated will prevent transmission? We don\u2019t know this because the kinds of studies required to look at transmission are different from the ones designed to test vaccine efficacy. The clinical trials testing vaccine efficacy showed *personal* benefit \u2013 in other words, if you get vaccinated, will you be protected? And the answer to that as we\u2019ve seen is yes, for all three of the vaccines currently authorized for use and being distributed in the U.S. But looking at transmission is a different matter altogether.  \\n\\nIn the phase 3 trials there were thousands and thousands (approximately 30,000 participants) who were tested regularly (approximately once a week) to see if they got *symptomatic* COVID-19. But to test whether the virus was colonizing in the nose would have required near-daily testing. And if you pause to consider that \u2013 30,000 persons over five months \u2013 with each person coming in daily to get their nose swabbed, it would have become impossible to test all the cultures in a timely way. We would have been diverted from defining vaccine efficacy.  \\n\\nIt is possible to take fewer people and do what we call a transmission study, which is currently being conducted with the mRNA vaccines. We will look at vaccinated versus unvaccinated persons and determine if vaccination prevents you from transmitting the virus. This will require intensive contact tracing \u2013 looking at the contacts, who got infected, who didn\u2019t? Who came first; who came second? Can we define exactly this person got it from that person? Sometimes the genetics of the virus allows one to do that.  \\n\\nThe emerging variants also complicate things because they have been shown to be more infectious. For example, the B.1.1.7 strain first seen in the UK has been shown to cause 30% more infections. It appears to be shed for a substantially longer period of time than the G614D strain, which makes it more infectious. As the virus adapts, these new strains will cause a stress on vaccinations. But I think we can almost be happy that we\u2019re doing the transmission study during the period of time when the virus is changing because we really do get at the relevant issue of how well these vaccines perform when the virus is starting to mutate.  \\n\\nSo, we are getting to answers, but it will take some time. With a little luck, the transmission study will show the mRNA vaccines are spectacular at working to prevent COVID-19 altogether. Or if you do acquire it, the viral loads are trivial, and you won\u2019t transmit it to anyone else. I\u2019m hoping that\u2019s the result because I want to take off my mask. But until we know this with reasonable certainty, or at least until more of our population is vaccinated, then public policy \u2013 and individual conscience \u2013 should mandate mask use in public spaces and any but small gatherings in our homes. The CDC guidance is clear that fully immunized people can meet each other at home, in small groups, without mask wearing and social distancing, but we\u2019re going to have to maintain vigilance in public spaces, at work, on public transport, and at schools as they reopen. Mathematical modeling shows that without adhering to these measures, we could double the deaths. How each one of us behaves makes a difference. Together, we can markedly influence the surges associated with this virus and potentially save lives.  \\n","legacyIsNew":false,"isDrafted":null,"order":0,"date":"03/09/21","attachments":[],"verticals":[],"authors":["chris-beyrer-md","larry-corey"]},{"id":42,"slug":"with-an-rna-virus-the-past-doesn-t-predict-the-future","meta":{"path":"/vaccines/blog/with-an-rna-virus-the-past-doesn-t-predict-the-future","title":"With an RNA Virus, the Past Doesn\u2019t Predict the Future","description":"COVID-19 VACCINE MATTERS: A blog series discussing the evolving science and policy of COVID-19 vaccines, led by internationally renowned experts in vaccine development, Dr. Larry Corey of the Univeristy of Washington, and Dr. Chris Beyrer of Johns Hopkins University.","image":"/images/assets/JHU-Blog-Brand-JHUUW-02_0c03ab0ec1.jpeg"},"section":"Vaccine Blogs","title":"With an RNA Virus, the Past Doesn\u2019t Predict the Future","subtitle":null,"caption":"*The views and opinions expressed here are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the position of either Johns Hopkins University and Medicine or the University of Washington.*","content":"- Clinical trials focused on the efficacy of the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines after two doses as opposed to the J&J vaccine, which was studied as a one-dose vaccine  \\n- A single dose of an mRNA vaccine offers much less protection than the single dose of the J&J vaccine  \\n- Given the likelihood of future variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we should focus on administering two doses of the mRNA vaccines, to ensure maximum effectiveness  \\n\\nLately, the visual and print media has featured several prominent people \u2013 including leading epidemiologists \u2013 who believe that for the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines, a one-dose-for-more-people approach is the correct course of action to immunize individuals quickly and create vaccine-elicited immunity among the public. They acknowledge that a second dose should be given, but they don\u2019t think that the timing of that second dose is as essential as one-dose partial protection. Some think it\u2019s okay to have a lag time from the first dose to the second of two or three months rather than three or four weeks, as was done in the clinical trials and authorized by the FDA under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) last December. When numerous people with import and influence are saying the same thing, one assumes that the ideas shouldn\u2019t be dismissed, and there are cogent reasons for the stance. So, let\u2019s pause and unpack these ideas a bit.  \\n\\nSubstantial data demonstrate partial efficacy after one dose of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Data from the initial Pfizer trial showed that between day 12 and day 21 \u2013 between the first and second dose \u2013 there was a flattening in the incidence of COVID-19 acquisition in the vaccine versus placebo group with an efficacy of 52% (39 participants in the vaccine group acquired disease and 82 infections occurred in the placebo group). There are corroboratory data from Israel with efficacy data in the 50% range. The data in the Moderna trial were essentially the same. From randomization to dose two, there were 7 cases of infection in the vaccine group and 46 COVID-19 cases in the placebo group; so, on purely clinical grounds, the epidemiologist argues that more societal good could be derived by vaccinating two persons with 50% efficacy versus one person with 95% effectiveness. It poses an interesting decision to make on a personal level with respect to informed consent in telling someone they are giving up 95% after 3 or 4 weeks versus 50% efficacy until they get their next dose. Irrespective of the debate about this issue, I don\u2019t think the real answer lies in a debate about the ethics of reduced efficacy from single-dose immunization or the efficiency of public health versus individual rights. The important thing to ask is, would we actually be doing more harm than good by administering one dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine to more people?  \\n\\nWhy do I suggest this?  \\n \\nI say that because the viruses we\u2019re going to encounter today and what we will encounter in the next several months are not the same viruses that we tested the vaccines on and upon which the single-dose data are based; they are going to be more formidable adversaries. The variants that are emerging and taking over have higher infectivity and have learned to escape from neutralizing antibodies. We have learned that the seeding of that escape is among people with low/partial immune responses through natural infection, which means the virus has a greater opportunity inside the body to replicate. In this context, as weak immune responses occur, variants can mutate in the face of partial protection and this persistent replication can lead to prolonged viral shedding from the nose and mouth and subsequent community transmission. The infecting viruses are stressed but not eliminated by partial immunity. How do we overcome escape variants? We do so by using the full strength of the tools we have available to us. We provide immunity that is capable of eliminating the virus quickly and we don\u2019t expose the virus to lots of people with low levels of immunity.  \\n\\nWhen we look at the protective antibody levels at day 21 after the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, we see that the 50% serum neutralization titer is 29; 7 days after the second dose, it is 270 and 7 more days later, it\u2019s 437! To offer a comparison, a level of 29 is equal to a low-dose convalescent plasma treatment, which has been associated with being a precursor for escape variants to emerge among immunosuppressed persons. The data with Moderna are similar: after one dose, the geometric mean titer of neutralization is only 18; 7 days after dose two, it\u2019s 256; and 7 days after that, it\u2019s 344.  \\n\\nThe data we have on efficacy are derived from the clinical trials that were designed to match the vaccine strain with the original \u2013 or what some call \u201cwild type\u201d (Washington strain) \u2013 virus. We\u2019ve recently seen the impact of the new variants on vaccine efficacy: the B.1.1.7 strain first identified in the UK required two- or three-fold more antibodies to neutralize; and the B.1.351 variant emerging from South Africa six- to ten-fold. It\u2019s a pretty simple math equation to go from a titer of 20 after one dose of mRNA and come up with titers of less than 10 for the UK variant and neutralizing titers that \u201cfall off the grid\u201d for the B.1.351 strain (less than 5), which is essentially a titer that is not accurately measurable in any assay. This equation is very different after the second dose of mRNA vaccine, when a twofold reduction for 450 is 225 and even if one encounters the B 1.351 variant, it\u2019s about a neutralizing titer of 1:75; 3.5 times the neutralizing levels above that seen with one dose.  \\n\\nLow antibody levels with one dose are magnified in the elderly, many of whom have titers less than 20; the elderly invariably require two doses to get a detectable neutralizing response. A similar situation is also seen among persons with a wide variety of chronic diseases: their less-than-robust immune response will have an even greater impact on levels of protection after one dose. Data on the origin of escape variants point to immunosuppressed patients and persons with untreated HIV as reservoirs for the selection of escape mutations, especially with the E484K mutation.\\nMy compatriots say if one dose works for Johnson & Johnson (J&J), why not do the same with Pfizer and Moderna? There is a difference: there is a much greater CD8+ T cell response in the J&J vaccine at one dose than with the mRNA vaccines after only one dose. It\u2019s really a different mechanism of protection.  \\n\\nWhile my musings are inferential, I feel we will actually do more harm than good by markedly increasing the population of people with partial protective immunity.  \\n\\nI think it behooves us to solve the challenge of vaccinating our population by first immunizing with the regimens that we know have demonstrated high efficacy. Even with this approach, antibody titers will be stressed with the duration of time and the increase of circulating strains. Depending on the past is not how an RNA virus behaves. It uses the past to change its future in order to survive, so mitigating our best efforts is likely to be counterproductive. Good epidemiology does not necessarily mean good virology. This is one area where the past does not dictate the future. We need all the strength we can muster in the vaccine regimens. For the two mRNA vaccines, I want my friends and family to be immunized with the two-dose schedules as outlined in the FDA EUA-approved application. \\n","legacyIsNew":false,"isDrafted":null,"order":0,"date":"03/18/21","attachments":[],"verticals":[],"authors":["larry-corey"]},{"id":50,"slug":"u-s-vaccine-supply-appears-to-be-surpassing-demand","meta":{"path":"/vaccines/q-n-a/u-s-vaccine-supply-appears-to-be-surpassing-demand","title":"Q&A: U.S. Vaccine Supply Appears To Be Surpassing Demand","description":"The United States government and partners in the pharmaceutical industry developed, manufactured, and evaluated safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines in record time.

And by May 2021, the public and private sectors transported, stored, and injected nearly [238 million doses of vaccines](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/vaccines/us-states) into American arms all across the country. One last monumental task awaits: Getting vaccines to the hardest-to-reach individuals and those who are hesitant to be vaccinated, allowing vaccine supplies to exceed demand. William Moss, executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center, discusses the challenges that all successful vaccination campaigns eventually face. ","content":"### What is the biggest concern when vaccine supplies begin to outpace demand?  \\n\\nOne of the major problems about vaccine supplies exceeding demand is vaccine wastage.  \\n\\nWe do not want to have areas of the nation where vaccines are just sitting in freezers not being used. There is a saying that \u2018vaccines save lives.\u2019 But it\u2019s slightly incorrect. Vaccines don\u2019t save lives. Vaccinations save lives. Every dose represents another person who could be protected from severe COVID-19 or, worse, death.  \\n\\nAnd that\u2019s really the biggest concern about unvaccinated populations in the United States: Those people are going to be at high risk of getting infected and getting severe disease. If there are enough of them, they could potentially overwhelm the health care systems and we could continue to see people dying.  \\n\\n### Do vaccines have shelf lives?  \\n\\nThere is shelf life for vaccines and it\u2019s actually shorter than for most medications. We\u2019re talking about fairly short timelines on these vaccines.  \\n\\nTake the Pfizer vaccine, for example. Once that vaccine ships out it can be stored for up to six months if it\u2019s kept in ultra-cold freezers. If kept in a shipper, the shelf life is 30 days. If it\u2019s taken out and put in refrigerators, the shelf life is only five days.   \\n\\n---  \\n\\n> \u2018People who don\u2019t get vaccinated often underestimate the risk of disease and overestimate the risk of the vaccine\u2019  \\n\\n\\n###  Who are the hard-to-reach individuals who are causing diminishing demand?  \\n \\nEarly in mass vaccination campaigns you quickly reach the people who have access to vaccines and the people who want to get vaccinated. We\u2019ve made tremendous progress in vaccinating people in the United States, but there are still many people who remain to be vaccinated.  \\n\\nThe reasons vary for why [people are hesitant](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/vaccines/q-n-a/people-hesitant-to-receive-vaccines-need-empathy-from-medical-providers) to get vaccinated.  \\n\\n- Many people have safety concerns because they fear these vaccines were rushed and we don\u2019t know what the long-term consequences might be.  \\n- There are also concerns about the efficacy of the vaccines to protect against the virus.  \\n- And some people just believe they\u2019re not at high risk for getting a severe case of COVID-19.  \\n\\nWhile it\u2019s true that younger people are at a lower risk than older people, everyone is at risk. No unvaccinated person can be sure they will not get severe disease.  \\n\\nPeople underestimate the risk of the disease to themselves and overestimate the risk of the vaccine. It\u2019s that kind of risk calculus that leads many people to choose not to get vaccinated. \\n\\nThere is a small proportion in the United States who are anti-vaxxers and there is no amount of information or persuading that is going to change their minds. But there are lots of people in the United States whose decisions can be changed with appropriate messages from the right messengers.  \\n\\n> \u2018There is no magical threshold that we can reach with vaccination coverage where the virus will just go away.\u2019  \\n\\n### What can be done to encourage more people to get vaccinated?  \\n\\nThere\u2019s been a fair amount of outreach conducted but much more needs to be done. It gets harder and harder to reach people as we are seeing in the United States. And this is typical of vaccination campaigns. You always have this remaining piece of the population that is hard to reach.  \\n\\nWe need to intensify our efforts going forward to reach those who are hesitant. The efforts really need to be at very local levels. We need the influencers in people\u2019s lives and in their communities to advocate for vaccination.  \\n\\nThat can be health care workers, community leaders, religious leaders, church leaders. All of those leaders at the very local level need to address the specific concerns of the people in their communities. That is the best way forward.  \\n\\n### Won\u2019t herd immunity protect people after a certain percentage of the population is vaccinated?  \\n\\nHerd immunity is a useful concept that we use frequently in infectious disease epidemiology. It basically means that in a particular population the probability of an infectious individual coming into contact with a susceptible individual goes to near zero because there is an abundance of protected people in that population.  \\n\\nThere is no doubt that as more and more people are protected you reach a point where you start driving transmission down. But that doesn\u2019t make the virus go away completely.  \\n\\nThere is no magical threshold that we can reach with vaccination coverage where the virus will just go away. It will continue to transmit wherever you have clusters of susceptible people, such as people who refuse to get vaccinated.  \\n\\n### Can the lack of vaccinations in a community result in the emergence of new variants that could bypass the vaccine\u2019s defenses?  \\n\\nI think the risk of new variants emerging is greater at the global level than at the national level in the United States. The big concern would be if we find variants that are able to fully escape vaccine immunity. We haven\u2019t seen them yet. But we\u2019ve seen variants that are more contagious and cause more severe disease.  \\n\\nThe dire situation that we\u2019re [seeing in India](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/region/india), with extremely high levels of virus transmission,  is an ideal setting for the emergence of new viral mutations and variants.

Black Americans are [more likely to get COVID-19](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/12/pandemic-black-death-toll-racism/617460/) than other races and are dying at nearly twice the rate of White Americans. They are also less likely to participate in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials and are [less willing to get the vaccine](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/report/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-december-2020/). All the same, these numbers portray problems in our society, not problems with Black people.  \\n\\nWe should look through the lens of lessons learned when Black Americans are left behind in public health preparedness. For instance, many parallels exist between HIV and COVID-19: Black Americans are also more likely to get HIV, less likely to participate in HIV clinical research and [less likely to benefit](https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/docs/factsheets/cdc-hiv-aa-508.pdf) from HIV prevention medications than other communities. While other communities mounted a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many Black Americans navigated intersectional COVID-19, HIV, racial discrimination and poverty.  \\n\\nWhat have we learned from both cases?  \\n\\n\u2022 **Words, images, and perceptions matter.** We are inundated daily with headlines about COVID-19 vaccine \u2018distrust\u2019 or \u2018hesitancy\u2019 among Black Americans. But what is the difference, and does it matter? In short, yes.  \\n\\nVaccine hesitancy is broadly defined as a continuum from vaccine refusal to acceptance. The headlines using this phrase imply personal preferences and views. However, there is plenty of literature that shows our individual decision-making to get vaccinated may be reduced because of seeing these very images telling us that Black Americans are not getting vaccinated. Very few of these headlines identify trustworthy sources for Black Americans to go for information about the vaccines. Even fewer headlines discuss the role of clinicians and researchers in working to overcome distrust and negative perceptions of the vaccine and in encouraging trust in vaccinations.  \\n\\n\u2022 **Trust is central to uptake.** Whether we portray it as hesitancy, mistrust, distrust or any other term, every Black American needs access to information about the vaccine and side effects. They need to know why some groups are eligible to be vaccinated before other groups and why high rates of vaccination are needed for everyone to be protected ([community, or herd, immunity](https://www.jhsph.edu/covid-19/articles/achieving-herd-immunity-with-covid19.html)). Black Americans are rightly distrustful of the short timeline to COVID-19 vaccine approval and production. There is not a single community in which we, the authors, have worked, whether on COVID-19 or HIV, where the legacy of ethical violations such as the [Tuskegee study](https://www.cdc.gov/tuskegee/timeline.htm) or [Henrietta Lacks](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/henriettalacks/) is not mentioned. If public health practitioners are not appropriately equipped to help Black Americans overcome these valid concerns, how can trust be built and vaccine acceptance be promoted successfully? Acknowledging these very real concerns, as the [U.S. Surgeon General did](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/surgeon-general-vaccine-distrust-black-americans-medical-racism_n_5fdfceadc5b60d4163435ed8), is a start in trust building, but we must continue to provide education about the process through which the vaccine was tested and produced.  \\n\\n\u2022 **Address the issue of access.** Across the media, we see portrayals of vaccine hesitancy in Black American communities, often with little to no effort to balance reporting on [vaccine scarcity](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/05/opinion/us-covid-black-people.html) due to lack of access. Stories abound of Black American communities where [low vaccine stock](https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/vaccine-access-hurdle-for-african-americans-not-hesitancy/65-71bafcee-3a9d-411a-9581-2bea28ac7955) is to blame for low rates of vaccination, not hesitancy. Additionally, structural racism has guaranteed Black Americans a poorer quality of care than others, even when they are willing to seek care. Even before vaccine availability, there were disparities in access to COVID-19 testing.  \\n\\nPublic health practitioners must take cues from people already leading these efforts so as not to dilute or duplicate; many of these leaders have worked in HIV prevention and know the pitfalls of repeating the errors of the past. Media outlets should also ensure accurate and balanced reporting that frames the whole community, not just one narrative of hesitancy. Partnering with [Black churches](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna364) and having [Black researchers and clinicians](https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/what-we-do/science-health-public-trust/perspectives/science-health-public-trust/science-health-public-trust/building-covid-19-vaccine-confidence-through-behavioral-social-science) in leadership roles in entities like the [COVID-19 Prevention Network](https://www.coronaviruspreventionnetwork.org/), the [National COVID-19 Resiliency Network](https://ncrn.msm.edu/s/?language=en_US&targetlanguage=en_US) and the [Black Coalition Against COVID](https://www.facebook.com/BlackDoctor.org/videos/702160070463068/) can prioritize engagement in Black American communities and go a long way toward building on assets and promoting vaccinations.  \\n\\nSo, are *we* getting the COVID-19 vaccine?

Even nations with successful vaccination programs are struggling to contain surges driven by Delta, which has spread to at least 100 nations, according to the World Health Organization. Delta is now the most common variant in the United States, where more than half of the population was still unvaccinated in mid-July. ","content":"### Do viruses always morph into so many variants?  \\n\\nThere is an enormous amount of genetic diversity with all viruses, and they are always mutating. These mutations arise from errors when a virus replicates its genome. Given the tremendous amount of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 around the world, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s surprising that we\u2019re seeing more transmissible variants such as Delta.  \\n\\nBut the virus doesn\u2019t have an infinite capacity to become more and more transmissible or continually evade our immune responses. It has to be able to bind to our host cell receptors, and there is only so much it can do to improve that binding. It may still have tricks it can pull off, but there are also evolutionary constraints on how much it can mutate in ways beneficial to the virus.  \\n \\n### How are variants identified and tracked?  \\n\\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [established a three-tiered classification system](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/variant-info.html) for variants: Variants of Interest, Variants of Concern, and Variants of High Consequence.  \\n\\n**Variants of Interest** are viruses that have genetic mutations that could be compatible with either increased transmissibility, more severe disease, the ability to escape immunity, or the ability to escape our diagnostics. They have mutations that we think could possibly do that.  \\n\\n**Variants of Concern** are ones that have actually demonstrated at least one of those properties. It\u2019s not that they just have genetic mutations that could have those properties \u2013they\u2019ve actually been observed demonstrating one of them.  \\n\\n**Variants of High Consequence** would be viruses that cause severe disease in fully vaccinated individuals and would require us to change our vaccines. We haven\u2019t had any classified in this category yet. Viruses missed by diagnostic tests also fall within this category.  \\n\\n### Why are variants named by Greek letters?  \\n\\nThe World Health Organization came up with the Greek letter naming. They did that for two reasons. The official viral nomenclature with the numbers and the letters was just hard for people to say and track. They also don\u2019t want to name variants after the places where they were first identified to avoid stigmatizing that location.  \\n\\nThe places where these genetic mutations are first identified are not necessarily where they first evolved. It\u2019s solely a function of how much genotyping countries are doing. The Alpha variant, or B.1.1.7, was first identified in the United Kingdom but that doesn\u2019t mean it first evolved there. The U.K. has been far out in front in terms of genotyping. It could have evolved somewhere else and the country of its origin didn\u2019t detect it.  \\n\\nHowever, I do believe the Delta variant did evolve in India where it was also first identified because of the tremendous amount of transmission that was going on in that country. That much transmission allowed the virus to mutate and evolve to be more transmissible.  \\n\\n\\n### Who is actually looking for these genetic mutations?  \\n\\nBoth academic and public health institutions are conducting the sequencing needed to find variants. The process requires two pieces. You must have the laboratory technology to fully sequence the virus, and you must have the bioinformatics to process and interpret the genomic data.  \\n\\nThe CDC has been criticized, and rightly so, for [not sequencing as many viruses](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/variant-data) as it should have earlier in the pandemic. In the U.K., the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) Consortium has been doing the sequencing there. It\u2019s a bit easier for them to do it because it\u2019s a smaller nation with a national health system.  \\n \\nThere are databases where everyone is supposed to submit their genomic sequences. Now these are [huge databases](https://nextstrain.org/sars-cov-2), and you can track the evolution of these viruses.  \\n\\n### Does every mutation render the virus more deadly?  \\n\\nThe vast majority of mutations are actually deleterious to the virus. They\u2019re dead ends. And many mutations are neutral. But then you get these rarer mutations that are advantageous to the virus. The way evolution works is that if there\u2019s a mutation that allows a variant to be more transmissible it\u2019s going to take over and the other strains with other mutations will fall away.  \\n\\nThe rate of mutation in SARS-CoV-2 hasn\u2019t changed. It\u2019s just that we\u2019re giving the virus more opportunities to mutate and evolve more transmissible variants, especially with these big surges in cases where there are many unvaccinated people. It becomes an amplifying cycle: you get a more transmissible variant that then causes more infections and that gives that variant more opportunity to mutate and evolve again.  \\n\\nThe Delta Plus variant is an example of this. Someone has called it a variant on a variant on a variant. They build on each other. The Delta Plus has one additional mutation over the Delta variant. But that mutation is in the spike protein, the critical place where the mutations are occurring because that\u2019s what allows the virus to bind to our cells. But it\u2019s also where our neutralizing antibodies are attaching.  \\n\\nThe Delta Plus has this one mutation that was seen in a number of other strains, but most notably in the Beta variant that was first identified in South Africa and that people think may help confer some escape from prior immunity. That\u2019s why the Delta Plus is of such concern because it acquired this additional mutation.  \\n\\n### How are the mutations constrained?  \\n\\nThe reason I say there are constraints is that some mutations are evolving to help the virus bind more tightly to our host receptors. But that\u2019s where vaccines are also targeted. That\u2019s where these evolutionary constrains come in. The spike protein in the virus can\u2019t change too much to escape our immune responses because if it does it won\u2019t bind to our host cell receptors. Maybe it can evolve to bind a little more tightly, but it can\u2019t completely change, or it won\u2019t be able to bind. By being fully vaccinated you\u2019re getting more antibodies in both magnitude and diversity. You are diversifying your immune response so that it can attack different parts of the virus with more antibodies and immune cells.  \\n \\n### Which vaccines are most effective against Delta?  \\n\\nThere is emerging evidence that the mRNA vaccines, particularly the Pfizer vaccine, are effective against the Delta variant, particularly against severe disease in persons who are fully immunized. For two doses of the Pfizer mRNA vaccine, there is a slight reduction in protective efficacy against any symptomatic disease. In the U.K., one study showed it was 88% effective against symptomatic disease with the Delta variant.  Some other studies have shown lower effectiveness, including data from Israel that received a lot of attention.  \\n\\nBut if you look at severe disease or hospitalizations, it\u2019s about 96% effective, according to the early data coming out of the U.K. And that\u2019s an important point. Sure, we want these vaccines to be protective against mild, even asymptomatic infection, because that will help reduce transmission. But what\u2019s really important is that the Pfizer vaccine remains very highly protective against hospitalization, or severe disease.  \\n\\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to get both doses. Early U.K. data identified a much lower efficacy \u2013 33% -- against symptomatic disease after only a single dose.  \\n \\n### Will the United States escape Delta-driven surges seen around the world?  \\n\\nThis pandemic is not over until it\u2019s over everywhere. The Delta variant highlights why the United States really needs to step up and do more than it\u2019s doing to fight the pandemic globally by getting vaccines out to the world.  \\n\\nWe are fortunate that the mRNA vaccines remain highly protective against the Delta variant. But what we don\u2019t want is a Delta Plus Plus or any variant that evades vaccine-induced immunity because that would be a major setback.  \\n\\nDelta shows us that the game is not over yet. We\u2019re seeing more highly transmissible variants. And Delta will hit hard the unvaccinated communities and individuals in the United States. We\u2019re going to see that increasingly. It\u2019s now making up about 30% of all infections in the United States.  \\n\\nPerhaps we\u2019ve moved too quickly in opening up and unmasking because it will be very hard to walk back if we need to in some communities, particularly if hospitals and intensive care units again are overwhelmed. We need to be open as individuals and as communities to the fact that we may need to return to some basic but highly effective public health measures if we experience a resurgence because of the Delta or another variant.\\n","legacyIsNew":false,"isDrafted":null,"order":0,"date":"07/15/21","attachments":["/images/assets/vaccine_qa_7_15_21_2_807caaa492.jpg"],"verticals":[],"authors":["william-moss"]},{"id":47,"slug":"what-johnson-and-johnson-pause-says-about-vaccine-safety","meta":{"path":"/vaccines/q-n-a/what-johnson-and-johnson-pause-says-about-vaccine-safety","title":"What Johnson & Johnson \u2018Pause\u2019 Says About Vaccine Safety","description":"Six adverse events out of 7 million people is \u2018extremely rare\u2019","image":""},"section":"Vaccines Q & A","title":"What Johnson & Johnson \u2018Pause\u2019 Says About Vaccine Safety","subtitle":null,"caption":"Six adverse events out of 7 million people is \u2018extremely rare\u2019","content":"### What To Understand About Vaccine Safety and the Johnson & Johnson \u201cPause\u201d  \\n\\n*On Tuesday, April 13, 2021, [U.S. health agencies called for a \u201cpause\u201d](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s0413-JJ-vaccine.html) in use of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine after [ongoing safety monitoring](https://vaers.hhs.gov/) identified a rare blood clotting disorder in six people who had received the vaccine.*  \\n\\n*Talking about vaccine safety is complex.

We do know that the benefit of the vaccine \u2014 keeping people from being infected with the coronavirus or keeping those few who get COVID-19 out of the hospital \u2014 vastly outweighs the small risk of experiencing the blood clotting disorder. To date, nearly seven million people in the United States have received Johnson & Johnson shots\u2014the vast majority have had no or mild side effects.  \\n\\n### Safety monitoring systems are doing their job.  \\nIt is common for regulators to investigate \u201csafety signals\u201d in medical products, including new vaccines. Very often, the signals prove not to be of concern. A vaccine safety signal is information that indicates that there could be a potential link between a vaccine and an event previously unknown or incompletely documented. The signal will suggest a new potentially causal association (or a new aspect of a known association) between a vaccine and an event, which could be either adverse or beneficial. It\u2019s important to be responsive to any safety concern. In the U.S., the FDA and CDC have [many systems](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vaers/index.html) in place to find, report, and investigate any adverse events\u2014even those that could turn out to be unrelated to the vaccines.  \\n\\n### If you experience an adverse event, report it.  \\nIf people who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine one to three weeks ago is experiencing severe headaches, abdominal pain, difficulty breathing, or swollen legs, they should contact a medical provider. Adverse events should also be reported to the CDC\u2019s [VAERS](https://vaers.hhs.gov/) system.  \\n\\n### Continuing to build confidence in COVID-19 vaccines is vital.  \\nHealth care providers, public health practitioners, and communicators must continue to develop clear, evidence-based, practical, and easy-to-implement approaches to mitigate vaccine hesitancy and [build trust](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/vaccines/report/building-trust-in-vaccination) in immunization.","legacyIsNew":false,"isDrafted":null,"order":0,"date":"04/14/21","attachments":[],"verticals":[],"authors":["molly-sauer","rupali-limaye"]},{"id":96,"slug":"breaking-down-data-silos-for-societal-well-being","meta":{"path":"/pandemic-data-initiative/news/breaking-down-data-silos-for-societal-well-being","title":"Breaking Down Data Silos for Societal Well-being","description":"Data silos prevent unification in support of solutions that encompass all possible impacts and tradeoffs for public health and economics.","image":"/images/assets/PDI_Polsky_ea31bafc4b.jpg"},"section":"Expert Insight","title":"Breaking Down Data Silos for Societal Well-being","subtitle":null,"caption":"Economics and public health have been billed as opposing forces throughout the pandemic. This tension arises from disparate data streams and analyses that fail to incorporate a holistic view of the problem and tradeoffs imposed by potential solutions. Linking data streams across specialties is our best hope for progress.","content":"Dr. Daniel Polsky is a Bloomberg Distinguished Professor of Health Economics in the Carey School of Business and the Bloomberg School of Public Health. Working at the intersection of healthcare and the economy, Dr. Polsky has observed that data scientists and policy advocates too often work in silos, ignoring the tradeoffs with other specialties. We must bridge those divisions to make meaningful progress on health and policy issues that challenge the United States.  \\n\\n### How do you balance health and economic data inputs when developing policy?  \\n\\nWe should be thinking about these things together. Policymakers must weigh many competing interests to make the best decisions for social well-being, but they typically receive information from experts in silos. Medical experts provide data on treatments, public health experts on safety, business experts on economic interests. Each of these experts want what is best for societal well-being, but by working in silos they each provide only a piece of what is necessary for informed decision making.  As a result, the decision maker is left to weigh these various interests.  \\n\\nWe can start bringing these voices together by acknowledging that there are tradeoffs and trying to present the tradeoffs, not leaving that up to the policymakers. The irony with the pandemic is that there weren\'t tradeoffs. Good public health is good economics. It really was a matter of people arguing for short-term personal economic interest versus the academic view of what\'s best for the macroeconomy in the long term. In the political sphere, people with the strongest, narrow interests usually scream the loudest.  \\n\\n> \u201cPublic health is not served by a lack of economic activity, and economic goals are not served if there is no public health.\u201d  \\n\\n### Are these tradeoffs the reason we didn\u2019t follow a purely public health approach and pursue a total lockdown in the beginning of the pandemic?  \\n\\nIt would have required an impossible level of collective action to get everyone in their homes for two weeks. In a lockdown, we need to address how we allow people to be home safely, which immediately interacts with economic questions. People need a long list of resources to be able to stay home for two weeks. It\'s not just about educating them on the public health benefits of staying home. It\'s about recognizing that there are constraints that they face that are honest and real. If we remain siloed and act with just a public health lens, we aren\u2019t going to address the unemployment insurance system, the Medicaid system, getting medications to people through the post office, and all the other things that are required to stay home safely. We should develop solutions based on data from multiple perspectives, not just public health.  \\n\\n### Free vaccinations and telemedicine have been solutions that encompass economics and public health. Does data show these systems are successful?  \\n\\nThese solutions have worked because they have largely worked around our fragmented health care system. Because the federal government paid for the vaccines, our fragmented health insurance system could be avoided. Because providers needed telemedicine when no one would show up, they embraced this mode of healthcare delivery. These solutions are patches for a broken healthcare system. If we organize our healthcare system to best advance health, it will be better prepared for the next pandemic.  \\n\\n> \u201cThe pandemic exposed all the sickness in our society.\u201d  \\n\\nThere is much to learn from data about what has worked during this period of adoption of telehealth, but systematic data is hard to come by. One issue with data from telemedicine is that we license providers through a fractured, state-by-state system, and there is no way to track who\'s delivering these services nationally. We need to put regulatory systems in place for licensing providers and tracking who can and should deliver telemedicine. We can\u2019t collect data if we aren\u2019t regulating it and don\u2019t even know who is delivering these services. There are many problems when data sits everywhere and no one knows who is collecting it.  \\n\\n### What improvements should be made to ongoing public health data surveillance efforts?  \\n\\nSurveillance is important, although it has a negative connotation. We need public health infrastructure to monitor infectious diseases and vaccinations, but there are challenges. For example, vaccines are being delivered across hundreds of different types of organizations, and they all have their own information systems. How can information that\'s collected and all these different sources be shared and standardized? I think there could be a new way of collecting data that isn\'t based on public health methods from 100 years ago \u2014 the electronic medical record equivalent of public health services. Right now, everyone collects information their way, then submits standard forms to the CDC. There could be ways for that to happen automatically through advanced information systems.  \\n\\n### What multi-faceted data streams could we use to identify barriers to health and well-being?  \\n\\nWe have some infrastructure in place to collect information in a well-established, thorough way. There are health surveillance surveys that may be run through the National Center for Health Statistics, census-style surveys run through the Census Bureau, and economics surveys through the Bureau of Labor Statistics. These surveys are still the foundation of the data we collect, but they don\u2019t connect with each other. It\u2019s frustrating when you go to the American Community Survey and there are opportunities missed to ask things outside of basic socio-economics. I could imagine a task force that brings these already established instruments together.  \\n\\n> \u201cThrough the pandemic, we have realized that the linkages between silos of data are more important than we previously recognized.\u201d  \\n\\nAlso, there are so many private sector datasets that mine data from everywhere. Private companies probably know more about individuals than the government, and researchers can\u2019t access that data. Twitter or Google using data to target ads to you is somehow more acceptable for society than the government collecting those data. The government is accountable to its citizens; who knows who Google is accountable to? These private purveyors of data should share information, possibly through a public health surveillance system that\'s run by the private sector.  \\n","legacyIsNew":false,"isDrafted":null,"order":0,"date":"08/11/21","attachments":["/images/assets/PDI_Polsky_ea31bafc4b.jpg"],"verticals":["pandemic-data-initiative"],"authors":["joshua-e-porterfield-ph-d"]},{"id":45,"slug":"covid-19-transmission-linked-to-behavioral-not-meteorological-factors","meta":{"path":"/tracking/q-n-a/covid-19-transmission-linked-to-behavioral-not-meteorological-factors","title":"Q&A: Covid-19 Transmission Linked To Behavioral Not Meteorological Factors","description":"Government officials should not relax COVID-19 control measures based on weather and climate conditions, according to a recent report from a World Meteorological Organization team co-chaired by Benjamin Zaitchik, a Johns Hopkins Professor in the Department of Earth & Planetary Sciences.","image":""},"section":"Tracking Q & A","title":"Q&A: Covid-19 Transmission Linked To Behavioral Not Meteorological Factors","subtitle":null,"caption":"Government officials should not relax COVID-19 control measures based on weather and climate conditions, according to a recent report from a [World Meteorological Organization](https://public.wmo.int/en) team [co-chaired by Benjamin Zaitchik](https://hub.jhu.edu/2020/09/18/ben-zaitchik-leads-world-meterological-organization-task-force/), a Johns Hopkins Professor in the [Department of Earth & Planetary Sciences](https://eps.jhu.edu/).

COVID-19 transmission dynamics in 2020 appear to have been controlled primarily by government interventions rather than meteorological factors. Other relevant drivers include changes in human behavior such as physical distancing, mask wearing, and travel routes as well as demographics of affected populations and, more recently, virus mutations.  \\n\\nWe are not saying that weather is not a factor at all in COVID-19 transmission. Is it an influence? Possibly, but the direct evidence is mixed. Do we expect that a disease like this might, eventually, fall into a seasonal pattern like the flu? Yes, a few studies are pointing toward that, and experience from other diseases suggests that it\u2019s likely.  \\n\\n> \u201cDirect evidence is mixed on weather\u2019s role in COVID-19 transmission.\u201d  \\n\\nWhen we talk about seasonality, what do we mean? Behavior is a huge part of it. Does it mean that cases go up in the winter because the cold outside favors virus transmission, or because when it\u2019s cold outside people spend more time inside with one another? It could be both.  \\n\\nLaboratory studies of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, have yielded some evidence that the virus survives longer under cold, dry, and low ultraviolet radiation conditions. However, these studies have not yet indicated if direct meteorological influences on the virus have a meaningful influence on transmission rates under real world conditions.  \\n\\nPeople are more susceptible to infection when it\u2019s cold and dry outside, and that\u2019s when we gather indoors. And the buildings we gather in are designed to be low ventilation in order to be more energy efficient. All of that contributes. Most disease transmission happens inside and we live our lives indoors.  \\n\\nThe Christmas holiday was associated with a COVID-19 spike in the United States, but there was also a Christmas-related spike in South Africa, which celebrates Christmas in their summer.  \\n\\n### What should U.S. state and federal agencies take away from the World Meteorological Organization\u2019s task force\u2019s findings as the weather warms up?  \\n\\nAt this state, evidence does not support the use of meteorological and air quality factors as a basis for governments to relax their interventions aimed at reducing transmission. We saw waves of infection rise in warm seasons and warm regions in the first year of the pandemic, and there is no evidence that this couldn\u2019t happen again in the coming year.  \\n\\n### Why did the World Meteorological Organization convene a task force to examine the science behind environmental influence on COVID-19 transmission?  \\n\\nA staggering number of papers and pre-prints were issued last year based on unreliable data and questionable modelling techniques that did not account for numerous factors that were co-occurring at the beginning of the pandemic. If you don\u2019t account for those other factors then you can incorrectly conclude that a trend in COVID-19 data is a product of Meteorology and Air Quality, or MAQ, effects. For example, if mask mandates and travel restrictions come into place as spring is turning into summer, you might find that COVID-19 spread slows while it\u2019s getting warmer. But that doesn\u2019t mean it slowed because the weather was getting warmer.  \\n\\nAll of these rapidly posted papers were leading to confusion, so in the summer of 2020 the WMO\u2019s Research Board convened the task team to perform a rapid summary of expert-informed assessment of the peer-reviewed literature before the January 2021 cutoff. We didn\u2019t examine every peer-reviewed study. We included studies that we believed were indicative of the best state of the science. There was a lot of chaff out there.  \\n\\n> \u2018Studies published without peer review can influence public health decisions and public perceptions about disease risk.\u2019  \\n\\nMany researchers were publishing questionable analyses with questionable data, and world leaders like President Trump and President Bolsonaro of Brazil were quoting these studies as if they were scientific fact. We have to avoid situations in the future where leaders can point to flawed studies by scientists in order to claim a disease will get better because of the weather. We don\u2019t want to slow down scientific progress in fast evolving situations like a pandemic but we have to figure out how to do some level of quick vetting of these studies. It\u2019s important, because a study that is promoted before peer review, or one that is published in a rapid publication journal with low publication standards, have the real potential to influence public health decisions and public perceptions of disease risk. For this reason, it is critical that researchers, publishers, and information providers maintain high standards for analysis and evaluation of emerging diseases.  \\n\\nEfforts to provide open, timely, and quality-controlled COVID-19 data have been disjointed and point to the need for a reporting infrastructure that supports data management and dissemination for analysis of epidemic diseases.  \\n\\n### Could COVID-19 be influenced by the weather in the future if it persists like seasonal flu?  \\n\\nThe report looks at the potential role of seasonality. Respiratory viral infections frequently show some form of seasonality, in particular the autumn-winter peak for influenza and cold-causing coronaviruses in temperate climates. This has fueled expectations that, if it persists for several years, COVID-19 will prove to be a strongly seasonal disease. That is still, for the most part, an expectation rather than a demonstrated fact. While some studies have begun to detect seasonality in the COVID-19 data record, these studies are highly debated. Overall, epidemiological studies of COVID-19 have offered mixed results regarding the meteorological sensitivity of the virus and the disease.  \\n\\n> \u2018Results do indicate that chronic exposure to poor air quality has been a major factor in COVID-19 death.\u2019  \\n\\nBut that expectation of seasonality does have strong support from those other, similar respiratory viruses. So Meteorology and Air Quality factors may eventually prove to be an important input for monitoring and forecasting of COVID-19 in the coming months and years.  \\n\\n### Do pollution and air quality influence the impact of COVID-19?  \\n\\nIt\u2019s pretty striking that even with all the limitations that exist in the COVID-19 data record, results do indicate that chronic exposure to poor air quality has been a major factor in COVID-19 deaths. That result is consistent and convincing, and I don\u2019t expect it\u2019s going to go away.  \\n\\nIt\u2019s important to distinguish between severity and transmission, though. The evidence that chronic and short-term exposure to air pollution exacerbates symptoms and increases mortality rates for COVID-19, and for some other respiratory diseases, is quite strong. But there is much less understanding of how pollution impacts the actual airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.","legacyIsNew":false,"isDrafted":null,"order":0,"date":"03/26/21","attachments":[],"verticals":["tracking"],"authors":["benjamin-zaitchik"]},{"id":49,"slug":"a-commentary-on-the-adverse-side-effects-of-the-covid-19-adenovirus-based-vaccines","meta":{"path":"/vaccines/blog/a-commentary-on-the-adverse-side-effects-of-the-covid-19-adenovirus-based-vaccines","title":"A Commentary on the Adverse Side Effects of the COVID-19 Adenovirus-Based Vaccines","description":"COVID-19 VACCINE MATTERS: A blog series discussing the evolving science and policy of COVID-19 vaccines, led by internationally renowned experts in vaccine development, Dr. Larry Corey of the Univeristy of Washington, and Dr. Chris Beyrer of Johns Hopkins University.","image":"/images/assets/JHU-Blog-Brand-JHUUW-02_0c03ab0ec1.jpeg"},"section":"Vaccine Blogs","title":"A Commentary on the Adverse Side Effects of the COVID-19 Adenovirus-Based Vaccines","subtitle":null,"caption":"*The views and opinions expressed here are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the position of either Johns Hopkins University and Medicine or the University of Washington.*","content":"- Extraordinarily uncommon but severe adverse events have occurred during the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine in Europe and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine in the U.S.  \\n- During a mass vaccination campaign, very uncommon adverse events are observed more acutely because of the large number of people vaccinated in a short period of time.  \\n- We have an effective adverse event surveillance system and it\u2019s critical that we continue to rely on this system as we weigh the benefits and risks associated with Covid vaccines.  \\n\\nClinical trials have given us a wealth of information about the efficacy and safety profile of vaccines for COVID-19. But the work of gathering evidence and weighing results in the context of an ongoing pandemic isn\u2019t done.  \\n\\nThe importance of developing population-based effectiveness and safety profiles associated with a mass vaccination campaign \u2013 assembling the deep datasets that go far beyond what\u2019s possible in a controlled a clinical trial \u2013 has been urgently demonstrated over the past three weeks.  \\n\\nExtraordinarily uncommon but severe adverse events have occurred with the administration of the AstraZeneca vaccine rollout in Europe and the Johnson and Johnson (J&J) vaccine rollout here in the United States. Intense public scrutiny of these rare adverse events prompted a brief pause in the administration of the J&J vaccine after about 7 million doses had already been given in the U.S.\\nWhen a mass vaccination campaign is rolled out, adverse events are observed more acutely and more accurately than during the slow trickle that goes with any other kind of vaccine or drug distribution. The infrequent becomes more frequent because the number of people vaccinated in a very short time is so large \u2013 a one-in-a-million problem becomes one per day rather than one every 2 to 6 months.  \\n\\nCritics of mass vaccination argue that these campaigns are fraught with difficulties. In some ways, this is true. Beyond the safety and efficacy profiles, there are logistical issues in mass production, quality control, and distribution. There are also the ongoing issues we\u2019ve seen with limited access and certain populations being left out and feeling a continued sense of separation from the vaccination process, reinforcing a distrust of the entire vaccine effort and the people leading it. It is also true that from a historical perspective mass vaccination campaigns have brought real risks: Guillain-Barr\xe9 syndrome was associated with the swine influenza vaccination campaign in the mid-to-late 1970s.  \\n\\nToday, we have a new disease to study called vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). It\u2019s also sometimes called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). This phenomenon has now been linked to both of the COVID-19 adenovirus-based vaccines \u2013 AstraZeneca\u2019s and to a lesser extent the J&J vaccine.  \\n\\nThis rare event was detected because it was unusual, like Guillain-Barr\xe9 syndrome with swine influenza vaccine. The persons affected by VITT presented with severe clots in their head, and when surgeons were looking at this and trying to treat it, these clots would reoccur right in front of their eyes. In addition, the blood components that were usually high in clotting disorders were low and, besides the clots, there was bleeding.  \\n\\nRare as it may be, physicians and scientists have seen something like this before. This observation was similar to an unusual immune response to the anticoagulant heparin. Immediately, investigators in Europe described this phenomenon in a small number of recipients of the AstraZeneca vaccine. They detected an antibody in the blood of people that activated the platelets (platelet factor-4) that cause blood to clot. This antibody seems to put the platelets in one\u2019s body into overdrive, which then results in a simultaneous clotting of the blood and depletion of the platelets, which causes bleeding.  \\n\\nClotting and bleeding at the same time \u2013 this is a very difficult condition and highly unusual.  \\n\\nIt is a clinical condition that\u2019s so unusual, it was instantly recognized and now it seems clear that it\u2019s a rare side effect of the adenovirus vaccines. VITT seems to appear generally in younger people, mostly but not exclusively in women, and usually within 4 and 14 days after vaccination but as far out as 28 days post-vaccination. \\n\\nWe\u2019ve now learned how to diagnose this disease by doing a blood test of anti-platelet factor-4, using the sensitive enzyme immunoassay. We can treat it by giving high doses of IV immune globulin to neutralize the autoantibodies, and (sometimes) administering steroids. It can also be managed by giving other kinds of blood thinners. Crucially, patients with this syndrome can\u2019t be given heparin, which has shown to worsen the disease.  \\n\\nThe disease is rare but sobering: about 30% of the persons with intracranial thromboses and bleeds have died.  \\n\\nTo date, in the United States, there are 15 cases of VITT among the 7.5 million persons who have received the J&J vaccine; 14 of the 15 cases are in women and almost all are under the age of 50, which equates to a case rate of about two cases per million vaccinated persons. A thorough review of the risk benefit of the vaccines was performed by both the CDC and the FDA and both of these organizations advised that people should be alerted about the possibility of VITT and to seek medical evaluation if they experience prolonged abdominal pain, worsening headache, or shortness of breath in the days following vaccination.  \\n\\nFurther, the FDA and the CDC made the determination that the enormous number of lives saved by the J&J vaccine far outweighed the risk of developing VITT and hence restarted the Emergency Use Authorization vaccination program.  \\n\\nTo give you a real-world example of the kind of personal risk benefit ratio we\u2019re considering, the data out of the CDC estimate that here in the United States, the odds of being struck by a car is about 1 in 4,292. And the odds of dying as the result of being struck by a car are about 1 in 47,273. And yet, this is a risk we all manage most every day, usually without even thinking about it. VITT, of course, is a new risk related to a new vaccine, so yes, we are all understandably cautious, but it\u2019s important to keep the risk in perspective.  \\n\\nThe advantage we have at this point is that we know how to diagnose and treat it, so there\u2019s at least a potential to lessen the impact of the disease. With this knowledge in hand, is it worth it? I think at the moment we have to look at the number of deaths in our country and globally from COVID-19 and weigh the risk of this rare but serious side effect against the overwhelming benefit of the J&J vaccine to fight COVID-19 symptomatic disease, keeping people out of the hospital and alive. And at the same time, we should continue to weigh the risk versus benefit as we learn more. The regulatory authorities, and the scientific community, should continue to communicate the risks and benefits of the vaccine in real-time as we gather more evidence.  \\n\\nWe should, and I think will, continue to use the science to drive policy. There are clear benefits for the one-dose J&J vaccine during this ongoing pandemic. Given its less stringent cold-storage requirements, the J&J vaccine is often the only viable option for hard-to-reach communities, and it\u2019s important to remember its effectiveness has been demonstrated in a well-controlled global clinical trial. It works not only against severe disease, but against a wide variety of variants. We also have an effective adverse event surveillance system set up, and the wherewithal to rapidly diagnose and treat people who develop VITT.  \\n\\nThis is an ongoing and important conversation, and there is much work to be done. The blood samples from the 44,000-person Phase III clinical trial need to be evaluated and we need to determine whether a large percentage of people actually develop antiplatelet factor-4. And if so, is it just a few who get *such* high levels that it sets this cascade off? If it\u2019s uniform, then we\u2019ll have to look at it more closely and determine *what really is the risk benefit ratio*? Is it good news because that means we can detect it early? Or bad news because it will mean we\u2019re going to need to continue careful monitoring? Or both?  \\n\\nOne thing is certain: we need to spend the time, energy, and resources to continue to ensure we do good surveillance.  \\n","legacyIsNew":false,"isDrafted":null,"order":0,"date":"04/28/21","attachments":[],"verticals":[],"authors":["larry-corey"]},{"id":75,"slug":"learning-from-failures-in-education-data","meta":{"path":"/pandemic-data-initiative/news/learning-from-failures-in-education-data","title":"Learning from Failures in Education Data","description":"Education data suffers from lack of public access to data, insufficient geographic resolution, missing detailed demographic data, and inconsistent messaging.","image":"/images/assets/pdi_6_29_21_thumb_a1d6494ff8.jpg"},"section":"Pandemic Data Outlook","title":"Learning from Failures in Education Data","subtitle":null,"caption":"Continuity of education has been one of the most debated issues during the COVID-19 pandemic. But school data has been too vague to provide the best information to support effective decisions by families and education officials.","content":"\\nMy goal with the Pandemic Data Initiative is to highlight opportunities for improving the nation\u2019s public health data systems by addressing issues exposed during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is not solely relegated to matters of COVID-19 testing and vaccination, but examines weaknesses across the entire data infrastructure of the U.S. public sector, particularly those areas that impact the very fabric of our communities and the social determinants of our health.  \\n\\nThe challenges in collecting education data are not dissimilar to those faced when collecting public health information: limited public access, lack of geographic resolution, insufficient details for effective decision making, and inconsistent messaging across levels of government.  \\n\\n### Public Accessibility  \\n\\nThe pandemic has shown that there is a high demand for relevant data to support personal and family  decision-making during a crisis. That desire is heightened  when the information involves the education of  children -- especially for families of color. In the US, black and brown Americans have historically received substandard  education<sup>1</sup>, healthcare<sup>2</sup>, and financial security<sup>3</sup>. Many American families must make difficult decisions as they navigate not just extremely constrained education circumstances but balance the stress of maintaining financial stability, ensuring access to nutrition, safe housing, and health. Some of the burdens families faced throughout the pandemic could have been eased by the availability of real-time data about COVID-19 in their school districts, as well as transparency in the actions school leaders were taking when articulating district policies. Some school districts rose to the occasion and developed their own COVID-19 dashboards to report cases, update student families on schedules,  and other resources such as meals on a school-by-school basis<sup>4-6</sup>, but this was by no means the norm.  \\n\\n### Insufficient Geographic Resolution  \\n\\nStates are composed of many different school districts. In some states, school districts straddle different counties and in others individual counties can contain multiple school districts. Such complex compositions pose a serious problem for understanding the pandemic\u2019s impacts on each school district when the best data available goes no deeper than the county level. It has been well established that schools that draw from different neighborhoods in the same district have disparities in education resources<sup>7</sup>, so it stands to reason they would experience the same disparities with pandemic resources. Without more granularity to COVID-19 data, schools were forced to make decisions based on a larger, aggregated picture that may not have reflected the state of the pandemic within individual neighborhoods associated with the schools.  \\n\\n### Non-existent Demographic Data  \\n\\nClearly every school serves students with a variety of educational needs. Schools could have benefited greatly from detailed demographic data on their students including English language use at home, food security, housing, transportation, and computer/internet access. When schools abruptly closed, many school leaders found themselves scrambling for data that could help to immediately invest resources in the right communities. In the absence of interagency or intergovernmental data sharing agreements, much of this data is not available to school leaders. The inability for school leaders to leverage data on social factors impacting students and families is not just an issue in pandemic times, but is a barrier to the delivery of comprehensive education.  \\n\\nWithout detailed demographic data, school officials were unprepared to handle the nutritional needs of their students and families, were unaware if students had computers or internet access necessary for remote learning, and were not certain if parents could handle the increased burden of supplementing teaching at home. Some school districts, such as in St. Louis, developed programs to provide take-home meal kits<sup>8</sup> to students, but did so without access to detailed information about student demographics and needs. There are now efforts to retroactively sample this data from school districts, but the data would have been much more useful at the beginning of the pandemic to guide open and closing decisions.  \\n\\n### Inconsistent Messaging  \\n\\nThere are clear benefits to decentralized decision-making during a pandemic whose landscape is constantly changing and whose effects are best managed locally. While one state may be experiencing a resurgence, another may have record low positivity rates. It wouldn\u2019t make sense for officials in both states to make the same choices about opening their school systems. However, as most states deferred responsibility to the counties and school districts, a patchwork of ever changing policies developed that confused families. In Baltimore City, for example, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan was arguing for schools to reopen by March 1,<sup>9</sup> while the Maryland State Education Association and the Baltimore City Council wanted more time before children returned to classrooms<sup>10, 11</sup>. The messaging remains confusing even now as we begin the discussion of reopening schools in the fall.  \\n\\nTo be clear, school boards, superintendents, and families were given a nearly impossible task with the COVID-19 pandemic. They were asked to make the best decisions for student safety without the best information and tools required to do so. As we prepare to return to school in the fall, it is important to consider the data infrastructure that could be set up to aid schools through the possible emergence of COVID-19 variants and other future public health crises. We should equip our schools with all the resources necessary to give our children a safe, healthy, and effective learning experience.  \\n\\n![eSchool-Reopening]()\\n\\nProviding this type of data to better support and inform families and educators is what motivated the team behind [Johns Hopkins eSchool+ initiative](https://equityschoolplus.jhu.edu/), which provides real-time data on school closures, reopenings, and the ethics of those plans. Dr. Ruth Faden, founder of the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics and key member of the eSchool+ team, said early on in the pandemic that \u201cparents are not equally positioned to protect their children on their own.\u201d<sup>12</sup> While this inequity is due to a variety of socioeconomic issues, we can at least strive to ensure that families are equally and fully informed with as much data regarding health and safety of education as possible. The work of eSchool+ has been a valuable resource to families, and has pushed for equitable planning for school reopening through the development of 12 principles of ethical and effective school openings (shown in the above image).  \\n\\nThis Wednesday, the Pandemic Data Initiative will publish an interview with Dr. Odis Johnson Jr. of the Johns Hopkins Center for Safe and Healthy Schools that focuses on how data could have helped schools during the pandemic and what needs to urgently change.

Devastating outbreaks have occurred, responsible for 37% of Covid-19 deaths in the United States. Many older adults have suffered intensely from the loss of contact with family members and restriction on activities, including medical appointments and outings. The most intense wave of Covid-19 cases in long-term care occurred from November 2020 to January 2021 in the United States, with more than half of states reporting all-time highest totals of long-term care cases of Covid-19 in December 2020. This spike in cases was surprising, since congregate settings for older adults have done tremendous work to prevent Covid-19. The winter wave of outbreaks and deaths in nursing homes occurred despite comprehensive infection prevention programs that included universal masking in nursing home facilities, much better (although imperfect) provision of personal protective equipment (PPE), no on-site visitors \u2013 including family members of residents \u2013 and mandated use of on-site Covid-19 rapid testing surveillance. These preventive measures were not 100% effective at keeping Covid-19 infections out of skilled nursing facilities. In fact, CDC assessed that long-term care settings continued to be affected as much as their surrounding communities.  \\n\\nThe massive case surge in nursing homes, and resulting illness and death, led directly to the prioritization of long-term care facilities for Covid-19 vaccines. The rollout of on-site immunization in congregate settings, which started in late December, has been a great success, with on-site immunization reaching 6.6 million nursing home residents and staff as of March 24, 2021. This tremendous effort, which reached 90% of nursing homes in the first 4 weeks of the program, has been a successful collaboration with community and commercial pharmacies. Further, it builds on what we already know about seasonal influenza immunization, where vaccination is efficiently delivered directly to the most vulnerable. By going room to room, vaccine coverage in a facility can be universal in just one day.  \\n\\nRollout of vaccination of long-term care staff has been slower, with some reluctance of staff to be \u201cthe first\u201d to get immunized. This translated into only 37.5% of staff accepting immunization in the first 4 weeks of the program. These attitudes of vaccine hesitancy are understandable for staff who have been traumatized as front-line workers this year. The rapid rollout also made staff feel rushed and pressured to receive vaccine, and roll-out was not accompanied by targeted staff engagement efforts to educate about the vaccine.  \\n\\nAfter three months, with much more information available, and with 90 million Americans now immunized as of March 28, long-term care staff are becoming more willing to consider immunization, after taking time to feel more comfortable with this new technology. Education and outreach efforts focused on this workforce are now underway, with vaccine education and engagement strategies focused specifically for these workers, recognizing their unique needs. The suboptimal vaccine roll-out among long-term care staff highlighted the needs of this essential workforce, many of whom work outside of licensed patient care roles, may have limited health and science literacy, and may come from marginalized communities. The rollout also did not take into account structural barriers to signup, including need for email accounts, fears about insurance coverage for vaccination, and language barriers. The issues that long-term care staff encountered within a highly pressured roll-out environment have basically mirrored some of the structural barriers revealed in broader vaccine rollout. The challenges of reaching full vaccination coverage in long-term care serve to remind us that targeted, community-based, specific outreach is needed for successful community vaccination campaigns.  \\n\\nToday, we already see dramatic improvements in deaths and illness in the long-term care sector. Age-specific data from Israel show that adults older than 70 years appeared to have equivalent vaccine protection to younger populations after receiving an mRNA vaccine; some preliminary data from nursing facilities in Connecticut released by CDC also show protection, even accounting for  the aging immune systems of long-term care residents. This is exciting data, especially because the older and frailer nursing home population has been shown to have reduced vaccine efficacy from other vaccines.  \\n\\nMonoclonal antibodies may be able to bridge the gap to protect long-term care residents and staff and save lives when vaccine coverage is not 100% or in cases of vaccine breakthrough infection. Preliminary data have been released from the Blaze-2 study, which showed that bamlanivimab decreased acquisition of Covid-19 among exposed long-term care residents and staff, and also decreased symptomatic Covid-19 disease among those infected. Monoclonal antibodies are available in the U.S. under Emergency Use Authorization, and data continue to accumulate on their safety and efficacy in long-term care populations.  \\n\\nSome future areas of focus for Covid-19 immunization in congregate settings include the need for consistent, careful, and respectful outreach to staff to help them have the information they need to consider vaccination. Since immunization is more accepted and the safety profile of vaccinations now established at the population level, many staff are reconsidering their initial choice to wait before getting immunized, and are now interested in vaccination. Even for facilities with high initial uptake of immunization, new staff are constantly onboarding, so access to vaccine education and to vaccination will need to be a continuous process. Similarly, new patient admissions to skilled nursing facilities, rehabilitation centers, and assisted living settings continue, and there is a need to immunize older adults new to facilities, or those who did not choose to be immunized but now would like to do so.  \\n\\nNow Medicare/ Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has released a new policy framework directing long-term care facilities to invite loved ones back into facilities for indoor visitation. The directions include when to suspend visitation (such as if new cases of Covid-19 occur in a facility) and remind us that long-term care facilities also will continue to conduct routine on-site Covid-19 surveillance testing for all residents and staff. Visitors are not required to be vaccinated to visit their loved ones but all visitors must adhere to facility infection control practices, which require universal masking at this time. While social distancing continues to be encouraged, CMS specifically encourages touching and hugs of vaccinated residents who are wearing a well-fitted face mask.  \\n\\nSkilled nursing homes, long-term care facilities, and assisted living residences were the site of tremendous suffering during the past year. It is incredibly promising that vaccination appears to be bringing a brighter future for residents, family, and staff.  \\n\\nAlison Roxby, MD, MSc, is an infectious disease physician-scientist and Associate Professor of Medicine, Global Health, and Epidemiology at the University of Washington. Since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, she has been involved in outbreak investigation and surveillance in skilled nursing facilities and assisted living settings, and brings that expertise to the Coronavirus Prevention Network. With a goal to fully incorporate older adults into Covid-19 prevention research, she has focused her efforts on community engagement with older adults and those who work with them, and expert protocol review to allow the fullest inclusion of older adults into vaccine and monoclonal antibody trials. \\n\\n\\n\\n","legacyIsNew":false,"isDrafted":null,"order":0,"date":"03/29/21","attachments":[],"verticals":[],"authors":["alison-roxby-md-m-sc"]},{"id":43,"slug":"pausing-astrazeneca-vaccinations-in-europe-a-tragic-decision","meta":{"path":"/vaccines/q-n-a/pausing-astrazeneca-vaccinations-in-europe-a-tragic-decision","title":"Pausing Astrazeneca Vaccinations In Europe A \u2018Tragic\u2019 Decision","description":"Many European nations \u2013 including France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, and Spain \u2013 recently paused the use of AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine due to alleged adverse reactions.","image":""},"section":"Vaccines Q & A","title":"Pausing Astrazeneca Vaccinations In Europe A \u2018Tragic\u2019 Decision","subtitle":null,"caption":"Many European nations \u2013 including France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, and Spain \u2013 recently paused the use of AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine due to alleged adverse reactions. The nations said they were waiting for the European Medicines Agency to declare the vaccine safe, which it did on Thursday, March 18. But the decision to pause the vaccine\u2019s use over concerns about rare blood clots may severely damage the continent\u2019s vaccination efforts moving forward just as the continent is experiencing a new surge in COVID-19 cases, says [William Moss](https://www.jhsph.edu/ivac/people/william-moss/), Executive Director of the [Johns Hopkins International Vaccine Access Center](https://www.jhsph.edu/ivac/). Pausing, he added, was a \u201ctragic\u201d decision that likely strengthened existing vaccine distrust that will be even harder to diminish.","content":"### Was halting the use of AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine due to safety concerns an appropriate decision?  \\n\\nPausing vaccinations was an overreaction. It was very tragic because it may lead to many more people dying of COVID-19. Pausing vaccinations would be far less problematic if transmission was low. But cases are on the rise in Europe. So if people are no longer getting vaccinated \u2013 or they\u2019re now afraid to get vaccinated \u2013 then many more people will become susceptible to getting the virus and perhaps being hospitalized and dying.  \\n\\n### Are adverse reactions normal with new vaccines?   \\n\\nYes. Adverse reactions are normal with all new medications, not just vaccines. Of course we need to be vigilant with watching for rare adverse events that follow vaccinations. Safety monitoring following the licensing of a new vaccine is mandatory. It\u2019s a normal part of the process. That\u2019s how these possible adverse reactions were detected in the first place. When any safety signals are recognized they need to be fully and rigorously evaluated, which they have been. And that, too, is a normal part of the process.  \\n\\nThe question here is whether there was enough of a safety signal or concern to pause vaccination.  \\n\\n### What other options do these nations have?  \\n \\nIt\u2019s a judgment call as for determining how much of a safety concern existed to warrant pausing vaccinations.  \\n\\nThe adverse events could have been investigated without pausing. There are countries that continued to move forward with the AstraZeneca vaccine. Britain continued with it and has used the vaccine more than any nation. And India and Australia also did not pause its use.  \\n\\nOutside of a vaccine trial that compares the reactions between people who receive the vaccine and those who do not, it can be very challenging to demonstrate that a particular rare adverse event like clotting is actually caused by the vaccine. You have to be able to show that people who have been vaccinated are more likely to experience those adverse events than a comparison group comprised of people who did not receive the vaccine. \\n\\nYou have to ask: Are the numbers of adverse events greater than would be expected in a population like this? A number of people have done those calculations and found the rate was not higher than these conditions happening in similar populations. And now the European Medicines Agency has also found it to be safe after reviewing millions of cases.\\n\\nIn this case it was not only the number of people who have experienced adverse events but the nature of these people: apparently many were young and may not have had any preexisting health conditions. That\u2019s what\u2019s got people worried and that\u2019s what needs to be investigated. \\n\\n### What other potential harm is there in pausing vaccinations?  \\n\\nWhat\u2019s potentially more problematic is how the pausing is going to be perceived by the public. The genie has been let out of the bottle. It will be hard to put it back even now that the EMA has declared the vaccine safe. It\u2019s hard to restore confidence in a vaccine after it\u2019s been paused in so many countries.  \\n\\nEach of those countries is going to have their work cut out for them to restore confidence in the vaccine now that the EMA found no causal relationship between the vaccine and bleeding issues.  \\n \\nTo restore confidence, they will have to prove they\u2019ve rigorously evaluated its safety and have been transparent about the evidence. And those efforts may not be successful. They may have undermined confidence in the vaccine, fueled anti-vaccine sentiment in Europe, and provided fodder for misinformation and disinformation about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines.  \\n\\nIt may be very difficult to recover. And, again, it\u2019s happening at a terrible time in Europe with this third wave of cases.  \\n\\n### The EMA declared the vaccine safe but is adding a warning label about possible rare complication of bleeding in the brain. How will that impact trust in the vaccine?  \\n\\nLet\u2019s say the investigations eventually concludes that one in a million people who get the vaccine may be in danger of developing blood clots. Then what do you do? The vaccine is saving many more lives than it is hurting. But is the public willing to make that tradeoff? This is the interesting aspect of how vaccines are perceived: the public has little or no tolerance for vaccines if they think they\u2019re not safe even if the vaccine could prevent many deaths.  \\n\\nThis is very bad. There is already a lot of vaccine hesitancy and skepticism in Europe and this is only going to feed into that.\\n","legacyIsNew":false,"isDrafted":null,"order":0,"date":"03/19/21","attachments":[],"verticals":[],"authors":["william-moss"]},{"id":54,"slug":"u-s-vaccination-data-has-improved-but-remains-incomplete","meta":{"path":"/pandemic-data-initiative/news/u-s-vaccination-data-has-improved-but-remains-incomplete","title":"U.S. Vaccination Data Has Improved, But Remains Incomplete","description":"The CDC needs to change recommendations to states into requirements.","image":"/images/assets/COVID_image1_f31df41b7c.jpeg"},"section":"Vaccination Data","title":"U.S. Vaccination Data Has Improved, But Remains Incomplete","subtitle":"","caption":"The CDC needs to change recommendations to states into requirements.","content":"As the news that U.S. officials had paused the distribution of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine rippled across headlines worldwide, safety and efficacy data points were scrutinized and debated on morning news shows and across social media. But with the FDA\u2019s decision to resume use of the one-dose vaccine in the U.S., another fundamental data point should have been called into question: How many doses are going into arms?\\n\\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued guidance for how states *should* report data to the agency. But in the absence of required standards and accountability, states are reporting different vaccination metrics in different ways, limiting our ability to track our progress against the virus. Even basic metrics, such as the number of individuals who have received one vaccine dose or who are fully vaccinated with both doses of the most prevalent two-shot vaccines, are not reported consistently across states. The mixed bag of approaches --counting doses administered versus people vaccinated -- is reminiscent of the confusing ways states report individuals tested and the number of tests performed, [as we detailed last fall](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/differences-in-positivity-rates). The same challenge that has hampered testing efforts across the United States is now limiting our understanding of the COVID-19 vaccination rollout. \\n\\nData reported by states became even messier as the Johnson & Johnson single-dose vaccine first entered the market. Some states such as Ohio and Mississippi have been counting the single Johnson & Johnson shots under two different categories: vaccine started and fully vaccinated. That makes it nearly impossible to precisely calculate the total number of people partially and fully vaccinated. And the CDC recently changed the data it provides to the public by lumping together the number of doses administered by state and federal agencies (the Veterans Health Administration, Indian Health Services, and Bureau of Prisons). As a result, the CDC\u2019s reported state numbers are inconsistent with the data reported by some states themselves. \\n\\nTo be clear, this problem did not begin with the current administration. We and our colleagues at the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, along with many other researchers, data scientists, and public health experts grappling with inconsistent public data have been calling for data standards for nearly as long as the pandemic has been ravaging the world. In his first 100 days in office, President Biden\u2019s administration has been hard at work rebuilding the nation\u2019s beleaguered public health agencies \u2014 institutions stocked full of the nation\u2019s finest scientific talent and expertise \u2014 squandered and silenced by a Trump administration that placed optics over data and politics before science. \\n\\nBut without federal standards and requirements to submit certain data, our nation\u2019s decentralized and overwhelmed public health system will continue to produce vital COVID-19 data using different metrics and reporting methods, hindering our responses and obscuring the extent of suffering the virus has been inflicting on the nation\u2019s most vulnerable populations. Just knowing the number of doses distributed and administered is not sufficient. We must be able to answer key questions: Who is being vaccinated? Where do they live? And what proportion of those in the highest priority groups, such as health care personnel and residents of long-term care facilities, have been vaccinated? We simply do not know. And we won\u2019t be able to know until the federal government imposes uniform standards and incentivizes state compliance.   \\n\\nAs of this writing the CDC reports that for the 97 million people fully vaccinated, they only have demographic information for 56 million or about 58 percent. Further compounding the problem, states use different and incompatible categories for race and ethnicity, and their reported data do not allow a determination of the number of people vaccinated across race/ethnicity, age, and gender. \\n\\nThere is clear and convincing evidence that COVID-19 is disproportionately impacting Black and Brown Americans. We know this because roughly a year after the first COVID-19 case crossed our borders, there is now widespread reporting of the race and ethnicity of cases and deaths. Yet we still have virtually no data showing which Americans have had access to testing in this country. And now the same blind spot has been extended to which Americans are granted the privilege of vaccination. \\n\\nFederal authorities have asked states to voluntarily report the race and ethnicity of vaccine recipients. But more than a year\u2019s worth of evidence makes clear that it will take more than a request to ensure consistent standards are applied. \\n\\nWe have marveled at the nation\u2019s ability to quickly develop several highly protective vaccines against COVID-19 and the Biden administration\u2019s remarkable success so far at converting vaccine doses into vaccinations for millions. But without accurate, timely, and standardized data across states, local jurisdictions, and federal agencies, there is no way to monitor progress toward national goals and ensure equitable access to vaccines and testing. As the second year of the pandemic grinds on, the Biden Administration has the opportunity to undo one of the Trump Administration\u2019s biggest mistakes last year by establishing such standards and a requirement to report key elements as soon as possible. \\n\\n*Beth Blauer is associate vice provost of Public Sector Innovation at Johns Hopkins University and co-founder of the [Centers for Civic Impact](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/differences-in-positivity-rates); William Moss is executive director at the Johns Hopkins [International Vaccine Access Center](https://www.jhsph.edu/ivac/).* \\n","legacyIsNew":false,"isDrafted":null,"order":100,"date":"05/17/21","attachments":["/images/assets/COVID_image1_f31df41b7c.jpeg"],"verticals":["pandemic-data-initiative"],"authors":["beth-blauer","william-moss"]},{"id":76,"slug":"q-and-a-data-for-improved-health-safety-and-education-in-our-schools","meta":{"path":"/pandemic-data-initiative/news/q-and-a-data-for-improved-health-safety-and-education-in-our-schools","title":"Q&A: Data for Improved Health, Safety, and Education in Our Schools","description":"Odis Johnson Jr., Director of the Center for Safe and Healthy Schools, discusses the role of data in educational policy and decision making.","image":"/images/assets/PDI_odis_6_30_21_4de8077229.jpg"},"section":"Expert Insight","title":"Q&A: Data for Improved Health, Safety, and Education in Our Schools","subtitle":null,"caption":"Dr. Odis Johnson Jr. discusses the need for detailed metrics on students in order to best provide resources and determine school opening policies that support all aspects of a child\u2019s learning: health, safety, and education.","content":"Dr. Odis Johnson Jr. is a Bloomberg Distinguished Professor and Director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Safe and Healthy Schools. As founder of the Institute in Critical Quantitative, Computational, and Mixed Methodologies, Dr. Johnson is an expert on data science and discusses the intersection between public health data and education that we explored in this week\u2019s [Pandemic Data Outlook blog](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/pandemic-data-initiative/news/learning-from-failures-in-education-data).  \\n\\n### What data is best for gauging how COVID-19 interventions affected children\u2019s education?  \\n\\nWe have no clue how our decisions and on-the-spot changes supported healthy outcomes for kids. We will not know how much growth rates and learning trajectories have changed during the pandemic, and what school resources and programs were actually impactful. I can\'t say that states and school systems have ever been consistent and uniform in collecting data related to those outcomes. We would have benefited from federal leadership on accountability measures for learning and data collection.  \\n\\nAlong with that, there are vulnerable populations that need additional support and we have no data to show what school systems did to support those high-need populations and what impact they may have had. For instance, since COVID-19 undermined homeownership for many families, we are not clear on how many children were homeless throughout this pandemic. School doors were closed so where were they learning? We don\u2019t have data on students whose families do not speak English as a primary language. When schools went hybrid or switched to distance learning, we relied more on those families to supervise instruction and be partners in their kids\u2019 learning. We have no clue how well that worked and what schools did to support that challenging expectation.  \\n\\n> \u201cThe pandemic has exposed a number of inequities that were related to learning before COVID-19 even happened.\u201d  \\n\\nWe\'re very impressed with Baltimore City Public Schools, which has been a thought leader on the impacts of COVID-19 on education. They actually surveyed families to answer some of these questions, broadening the arena of metrics that they might collect related to their students\u2019 well-being. It\u2019s not typical of school systems to collect data on metrics, and some may think they are not even relevant. We at the Center for Safe and Healthy Schools have been talking to school officials about how the lessons learned from the pandemic\u2019s challenges suggest schools should reform and what resources may be important in the future. Baltimore City has been actively engaged in trying to make sense of this opportunity.  \\n\\n### What information are we missing when COVID-19 data lacks school-district and neighborhood-level resolution?  \\n\\nDetails such as urbanicity, neighborhood determinants, and structural and built environment factors were definitely related to our ability to manage the pandemic and secure effective learning environments for kids. At the height of the pandemic it would have been great to have epidemiological rates of infection that were informed by structural determinants of transmission.  \\n\\nWithin urban space, we know that there are different environments and population densities that then relate to schooling and how successful mitigation techniques are likely to be. We know that in urban neighborhoods family size might be a little bit larger than average, population density tends to be higher, and with larger families and smaller living quarters it also becomes hard to implement mitigation strategies. We don\u2019t have any of that data or how it correlates to COVID-19, which would have been a great aid to schools and local governments during this pandemic.  \\n\\n### What is the importance of demographic data?  \\n\\nWithin the educational space, demographic data is critical because we find that families are differently situated to support the learning of their kids. Because of that we might see that some segments of the population actually didn\'t experience a setback in learning during the pandemic, whereas other populations that have relied on schools more probably experienced a greater loss. It\u2019s really important then for us to have that specific dis-aggregated data in order to understand these disparities and also to then extrapolate back to how this pandemic differed for populations given some of these things such as segregation, differential access to care, difference in co-morbidities, or the correlates of infection, hospitalization, and death.  \\n\\n> \u201cThe more we know about specific communities and their challenges within the pandemic, the better.\u201d  \\n\\n### How does data influence education policy and decision-making?  \\n\\nThere\u2019s a lot that makes basing policy decisions on the data a little challenging. For instance, the rate of vaccination is important for educators to know, but it is a sensitive topic. It definitely is important for us to have those data, but I question how actionable the data will be for health policy and educational policy decision making because of two major complications. One is trust; not only trust in the vaccine, but teachers trusting that their school systems and policy leaders have their health and wellbeing in mind. Second, there are those who have religious exemptions and health-related factors that exempt them from vaccination, which complicates policy making.  \\n\\nThere were a lot of decision makers this past year. At the ground level you have families and children making decisions based on their employment situation, childcare logistics, and a policy ecosystem that is rarely in agreement. Families are often confused by all of the messages. They hear the governor, the mayor, and the CDC, then they\'re conflicted in their decision making. Where they get their advice and whose advice they\u2019re following when they make these decisions are things that data will need to clarify to best inform our strategies for communicating with families in the future.","legacyIsNew":false,"isDrafted":null,"order":0,"date":"06/30/21","attachments":["/images/assets/PDI_odis_6_30_21_4de8077229.jpg"],"verticals":["pandemic-data-initiative"],"authors":["joshua-e-porterfield-ph-d"]},{"id":59,"slug":"axios-pay-now-for-pandemic-preparedness-or-pay-dearly-later","meta":{"path":"/pandemic-data-initiative/news/axios-pay-now-for-pandemic-preparedness-or-pay-dearly-later","title":"Axios: Pay Now for Pandemic Preparedness Or Pay Dearly Later","description":"Nations can not let current progress distract from preparing for the next virus.","image":"/images/assets/59_46c026e748.jpg"},"section":"Data Preparedness","title":"Axios: Pay Now for Pandemic Preparedness Or Pay Dearly Later","subtitle":"","caption":"Nations can not let current progress distract from preparing for the next virus.","content":"The United States and other nations must continue building a better national and global network of pandemic surveillance that includes transparent sharing of information and coordinated responses using real-time data, according to Jennifer Nuzzo, senior scholar at the Center for Health Security and epidemiology lead for the Coronavirus Resource Center. \\n\\nNuzzo spoke with the news outlet Axios about steps that are necessary for the United States and the world to be prepared for when -- not if -- the next pandemic strikes. And chief among her recommendations is reliable data. \\n\\n**Improve Surveillance**\\n\\nSince about 70% of newly emerging diseases stem from animal-to-human transmission, national and international surveillance is essential, she and other experts told Axios. That includes the ability for governments, not just academics, to conduct widespread genomic sequencing with faster, cheaper diagnostics. In addition, she added, [contact tracing](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/contact-tracing) is essential to halting outbreaks without lockdowns damaging economies. \\n\\n**Reward Reporting**\\n\\nThe World Health Organization relies on nations to report outbreaks to the international body. But many nations hold off out of fear they will suffer catastrophic economic impacts. A new international agreement is needed to provide assurances that nations will be rewarded with economic incentives, not punished, for reporting as quickly as possible. \\n\\n**Staff the Network**\\n\\nIf a broader, more reliable data network is built in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, who will staff it? In addition to building the systems, institutions need to train and hire a larger, better educated workforce to collect and review the information to avoid the threat of bottlenecks of data and analysis, Nuzzo said. \\n\\nRead [more here at Axios](https://www.axios.com/covid-lessons-pandemic-preparedness-c054705d-3f76-40c1-9ee4-a8c79163508c.html).

That conversation showcased the role of less visible data streams as the United States combats the anticipated development and viral variants including the Delta variant and other COVID-19 mutations. Variance and mutation are expected in the evolution of fast growing pandemics, and it\u2019s important to remember that the primary COVID-19 vaccines remain effective against Delta and all known variants<sup>1</sup>. **Getting vaccinated is still the best way to protect yourself, your family, and your community.**  \\n\\n### Delta Variant Abroad. \\n\\nThe first major news coverage of the, now dominant, Delta variant surrounded the humanitarian crisis it sparked in India in spring 2021<sup>2</sup>. At that time, India was experiencing low levels of vaccination<sup>3</sup> due to a lack of vaccine access, with most Covid vaccines produced in India exported internationally, and a fragmented deployment strategy hindered by lack of federal centralization<sup>2</sup>. This created an environment for Delta to thrive given its increased transmissibility compared to the original (wildtype) SARS-CoV-2 virus. In early March, Delta accounted for only 4% of all sequenced SARS-CoV-2 samples for India<sup>4</sup>. Just two months later, at the height of that nation\u2019s crisis, over 70% of sequenced samples were of the Delta variant (see image below). The death toll in India has passed 400,000<sup>5</sup>. Due in part to new efforts from the federal government, vaccination rates are now steadily increasing and cases are decreasing. The true impact of Delta in India is not fully captured by the data provided during the height of the crisis as health care systems were overwhelmed, resulting in significant underreporting<sup>2</sup>.\\n\\n![Stacked-International-Graph.jpg]()  \\n\\n**Data Source:** [JHU CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports) and covariants.org  \\n\\nFollowing the crisis in India, Delta has spread around the world. As of June 28, 2021, the Delta variant accounted for 84% of cases sequenced in Australia, up from just 1% three months earlier; 72% of cases sequenced in South Africa (up from 5%); 95% of cases sequenced in Russia (up from 0%); and 98% of cases sequenced in the United Kingdom (up from 1%)<sup>4</sup>. This increase in Delta tragically corresponded with an increase in COVID-19 cases. As we highlight in the figure above, there were 2,000 new Covid cases per day in the U.K. in mid-May 2021, which has now multiplied by a staggering 18 times to 36,000 cases per day. Similar trends are visible in Indonesia, Russia, and South Africa -- the rise of the Delta variant corresponds with a dramatic rise in case numbers, which were previously falling or stagnating.  \\n\\nThis phenomena is not necessarily exclusive to Delta, as the pandemic evolved variants that spread anticipated and could potentially happen again with a new variant, or in other countries that have yet to experience a Delta surge, making robust data collection ever more critical. Countries with lower vaccination rates are vulnerable to higher spikes of the Delta variant as restrictions start to lift across the world despite WHO warnings<sup>6</sup>.  \\n\\n### Delta Variant in the United States  \\n\\n![Nysa-US-Heat-Map.jpg]()  \\n\\nThe image above displays the rapid spread of the Delta variant across the United States from May to June 2021. Today, 82% of COVID-19 cases sampled in the United States are Delta as opposed to 2% two months ago, with a higher than average proportion states with more Delta variant -- such as Kansas, Missouri, and Nevada (dark red above) -- experiencing an increase in COVID-19 cases<sup>4</sup>.  \\n\\nThe rise of a new dominant variant in the United States is not alone a cause for concern; if 82% of cases are Delta, but there are only 100 cases nationwide, then there is nothing to worry about. However, as shown below, the rise of Delta in the United States correlates with a rise in COVID-19 cases. The 7-day rolling average for new cases is now more than double what it was just a few weeks ago. Vaccinations made it possible to keep case numbers lower than previous spikes, but the  trend is moving in the wrong direction with  more cases every week instead of fewer. Changes to data trends should be watched closely and we should be prepared to respond to changing conditions in communities.  \\n\\n![US-Delta-and-Cases.jpg]()  \\n\\n**Data Source:** [JHU CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports) and covariants.org  \\n\\n### Using Data to Combat Variants  \\n\\nDelta, along with new, higher transmissibility variants, could be allowed to fester throughout the country if we are not *regularly testing, reporting from every county, and updating data daily.*  \\n\\nTesting remains one of the most useful tools for tracking and combatting COVID-19 variants. Sequencing data is directly acquired from a subset of testing samples; therefore, the accuracy and broad impact of sequencing data relies completely on our ability to test. If a majority of COVID-19 tests are being done on healthy people in major cities that need a negative test for travel or work, then the testing sample pool -- which the sequencing data pulls from -- lacks data from lower population density areas of the state and for demographics underrepresented in the groups getting tested.  \\n\\n[County-level data are essential](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/pandemic-data-initiative/news/data-streams-are-essential-no-matter-how-small). If a new variant or a hotspot of Delta arises in one specific area of a county, we have to be testing there to identify the problem. As shown in the earlier image, Kansas currently has a higher than average proportion of Delta, but it has recently decided to only update reporting on county-level cases three times per week<sup>7</sup>. If there is limited case data for a county, then a reversal of trends would not be recognized until the variant has spread through the state sufficiently to impact the state averages, which could cost many additional lives.  \\n\\nLastly, the reporting cadence of states remains critical to combatting COVID-19 and its variants. As of last week, [39 states and territories have ceased updating their dashboards every day of the week](https://github.com/govex/COVID-19/blob/master/data_tables/US_reporting_frequency.csv), a significant increase from when I argued that [states should not reduce their reporting cadences last month](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/pandemic-data-initiative/news/we-need-a-daily-data-dump). Without timely release of data, shifts in trends are tough to spot until much later than necessary. Some states are directing residents to the CDC for data, but CDC data on COVID-19 variants is updated irregularly, and there is often a lag in their release of case data due to bureaucratic obstacles. States need to seriously reconsider their dashboard efforts as we try to combat the Delta variant together as a nation.  \\n\\nIt is clear that the Delta variant is deadly and spreading rapidly. Other countries have already suffered inconceivable losses from Delta transmission through their unvaccinated populations. Delta is already in the United States and spreading by the day. Because a majority of the country remains unvaccinated and susceptible to Delta, we need to capitalize on the resources and lessons we have learned from this pandemic to stop the spread and prepare for any future variant. It is not an impossible task, but it only becomes possible with data.  \\n\\n---  \\n\\nReferences  \\n1. Y.

Per capita funding for public health emergency preparedness has been decreasing steadily since the early 2000s. Historically, public health programs only receive reactionary funding when crises occur, and funds are often insufficient to maintain the same level of activity moving forward <sup>1</sup>. Similarly, in response to COVID-19, the United States invested in the wide-scale development of public health data systems, and funding remains available to maintain them <sup>2</sup>. As COVID-19 cases dip to record lows following a devastating winter surge, many states have dialed back their case reporting. But this is not the time to slow data collection and reporting; instead we must solidify and unify data systems to prepare for the next public health crisis.  \\n\\nThus far the United States has invested over $75 billion of additional funding in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to strengthen nationwide public health data infrastructure, something that should have been in place long before 2020 <sup>3</sup>. The Biden Administration is looking to invest another $3 billion in public health to prepare for the next pandemic <sup>4</sup>. This money will primarily be allocated in the form of grants to keep the public health workforce, expanded by the pandemic, employed in the coming years. Congress should expand this funding mechanism to include updating, maintaining, and transforming state COVID-19 dashboards into versatile public health surveillance tools.  \\n\\nThe public health community has already emphasized the necessity of data infrastructure maintenance once the pandemic resolves <sup>5, 6</sup>. This has become even more critical given  the recent announcement that American life expectancy has decreased by more than one full year over the course of the pandemic <sup>7</sup>. This indicates that after the pandemic there will still be substantial work needed to improve all American lives. Such an effort could be led by the CDC; however, there remains an urgent need for states to continue reporting their own data to the public. The most successful path forward is going to be the maintenance of rigorous data systems at the local, state, and federal levels.  \\n\\nThe state and national COVID-19 dashboards we have today are a great start and a novel concept in the United States. The average American can access data on a particular disease, investigate hotspots and infection rates, and browse pertinent articles directed at the lay public. The only major source of publicly available health data prior to this pandemic has been the Global Health Observatory, established by the World Health Organization to monitor global disease eradication <sup>8</sup>. The U.S. databases created to monitor COVID-19 could similarly be leveraged for other disease surveillance systems to improve America\u2019s health in the future.  \\n\\nAs the pandemic experiences a resurgence in certain countries, the United States can play a major role with regards to public health data infrastructure. We must help to build public health surveillance data systems in these countries and invest in public health data management systems that are supported long-term, not just temporarily for this pandemic. The health of the United States is deeply tied to that of the rest of the world. We need robust international public health data reporting systems to monitor genetic variants and disease outbreaks. That work starts at home by solidifying our own public health data infrastructure and serving as a role model for the global community.  \\n\\nThe Pandemic Data Initiative aims to formulate a framework for public health infrastructure development. This is not something the world can postpone until the next critical health emergency. There must be an intact, sustainable system of data collection so we are ready when the next public health crisis inevitably occurs.  \\n\\nLater this week we will be speaking with Dr. Lauren Gardner about the difficulties aggregating and analyzing public health data during this pandemic, and what the world should be learning from these efforts to better prepare for the next outbreak.  \\n\\n---  \\n \\nReferences  \\n1.

We suffered a terrible pandemic, with the most reported cases and deaths in the world for a long time. In addition, the U.S. government invested heavily in the development of the vaccines that have been very effective at helping us to combat the pandemic. But this is a global concern and needs to be a global fight.  \\n\\nNow that the U.S. vaccination effort has been so successful that we\u2019re worrying about supplies exceeding demand, the United States needs to be a real leader in that global fight. First of all, it\u2019s the right thing to do for humanitarian reasons to assist less fortunate countries. But it also serves the interests of the United States.  \\n\\nWe are at an inflection point in the United States and in other high-income nations where we need to turn our attention to the world. We can\u2019t drop the ball in the United States, but we need to turn our attention more globally. The Biden administration has given doses to Canada and Mexico, which reflects our self-interest since those nations border us.  \\n\\nThe big challenge right now is the vaccine supply, having enough doses. There are steps countries can take to try to address vaccine inequities and improve global vaccine access. There are increasing discussions with vaccine manufacturers to try to increase that global supply.  \\n\\nTemporary waivers on intellectual property barriers can help scale up vaccine manufacturing in a number of countries.  \\n\\n> \u2018The United States needs to be a real leader in the global fight now.\u2019  \\n\\n### How much of a risk is India\u2019s situation to the United States?  \\n\\nThe situation in India is a huge risk to the United States when you have transmission of the virus at such high levels as you do in India. It\u2019s a national security risk.  \\n\\nIf a variant emerges that can break through or go around our vaccines then we jeopardize all of our efforts to get to where we are today in the United States and elsewhere.  \\n\\nThe amount of transmission in India provides the virus opportunities to mutate. What we don\u2019t want to see are mutations that allow variants to evolve in ways to thwart the immunity our vaccines provide.  \\n\\n### What is most concerning about the situation in India?  \\n\\nIt is striking to see these high levels in India. I\u2019m beginning to wonder if people who were already infected before are getting infected again. It raises the question of whether reinfection is happening in India.  \\n\\nThe sad irony is that India has long been one of the largest vaccine manufacturers in the world, particularly for the AstraZeneca vaccine. India has exported more than 60 million COVID-19 vaccine doses to the rest of the world and now they need those doses for their own country.  \\n\\n### How do wealthier nations get vaccines and supplies to lower income countries?  \\n\\nFirst, it\u2019s crucial that the United States is engaging again with the World Health Organization after the Trump Administration had halted cooperation.  \\n\\nThe [COVAX Facility](https://www.gavi.org/covax-facility) is the primary global mechanism for getting vaccines to low and middle-income nations. It is part of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, a global collaboration set up about a year ago with the goal of getting 2 billion doses of vaccines to low-income countries by the end of this year. So far COVAX has shipped over 53 million COVID-19 vaccines to 121 countries. But that\u2019s far below what is needed. They\u2019re targeting health care workers and older adults and the most vulnerable citizens.  \\n\\nThe United States has pledged $4 billion to COVAX.  \\n\\n> \u2018Temporary waivers on intellectual property barriers can boost worldwide vaccine manufacturing.\u2019  \\n\\n### Are vaccines being distributed equitably around the world?  \\n\\nIt\u2019s very clear from our [map on the Johns Hopkins](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/vaccines/international) Coronavirus Resource Center website that there are gross disparities in vaccination access. Just recently the World Health Organization\u2019s director, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, commented that of the nearly 900 million vaccine doses as of May 1 that have been administered globally, 81% have gone to high or middle-income countries while low-and-middle-income countries have received just 0.3%.  \\n\\nThat is a huge inequity in vaccination access. The United States has been sitting on millions of AstraZeneca doses and has promised to share them with the world since they are not yet authorized for use and we no longer require them to vaccinated U.S. citizens.  \\n\\nThe United States and other nations with excess vaccines should donate them to the COVAX Facility or directly to other nations.  \\n\\n### What ethical dilemmas do nations face with the current global situation?  \\n\\nOne ethical dilemma that I don\u2019t know the answer to is rather interesting. As the United States lowers the age of eligibility for vaccines to younger and younger children, the nation will be faced with the ethical dilemma of vaccinating younger people who are less susceptible to the worst effects of COVID-19 in a nation where a large percentage of adults are vaccinated rather than diverting those vaccines to other countries where health care workers are in desperate need of that protection.  \\n\\nThe calculus around that dilemma gets more difficult going forward.

Estimates are that about 6.2 percent of adults ages 18-64 in the U.S. are living with weakened immune function, along with about 2.6 percent of children, according to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/8/19-1493_article). The prevalence of immunosuppression appears to be on the rise, as many people are living longer with cancer, HIV, organ transplants, or with chronic therapy that make people [more vulnerable to infections](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2572798).  \\n\\nThese people live in communities all around the U.S. They are your neighbors, your sister\u2019s friend, the person next to you in line at the grocery store.  \\n\\nWe have about 15 million people in the U.S. in this immunosuppressed group who are unlikely to mount strong immune responses to COVID-19 vaccines. They need some extra help from all of us to stay safe.  \\n\\nSo let\u2019s talk about COVID-19 prevention strategies for this group of vulnerable people among us. Let\u2019s start with patients who have received donor organs (like kidney or liver transplant recipients) or bone marrow transplants \u2013 who are on medications that suppress their immune systems to prevent graft rejection \u2013 as well as cancer patients whose immune systems have a reduced capacity to respond to vaccines because they\u2019ve received chemotherapies that kill off many of their infection-fighting white blood cells. The second immunosuppressed population, which I plan to discuss in a separate piece, are individuals living with HIV infection. The global COVID-19 vaccine and prevention story, largely narrated by data generated from the USG COVID Vaccine (formerly Operation Warp Speed) program, did not include immunosuppressed persons in the clinical trials of the COVID-19 vaccines approved under Emergency Use Authorization in the U.S.  \\n\\nAs the architect of these trials, I need to do some explaining here, especially because as a physician and scientist, I have spent almost all of my career working with immunosuppressed patients. When we started the clinical trials, we had no idea how effective these vaccines would be. Speed and efficiency in trial conduct were necessary. We needed vaccines for the majority of the U.S. adult population, and we needed them fast.  \\n\\nWe knew that immunocompromised people, historically, are less likely to respond to vaccines than people with competent immune systems. There was also an issue with background noise. Because of all the medications immunosuppressed people take, it\u2019s hard to tell if side effects of vaccines or monoclonal antibodies were caused by the new agent we were testing, or by other infections the immunocompromised person may have picked up coincidentally. For this reason, including these patients in the initial efficacy trials would have been problematic. It likely would have slowed down the trial and complicated the interpretation of side effects and hospitalizations.  \\n\\nMoreover, when we initiated the trials in summer 2020, we were concerned about the possibility of vaccine-induced COVID-19 disease enhancement. Fortunately, this is something we now know has not occurred in any of the vaccine trials.  \\n\\nExcluding immunosuppressed patients from the *initial* Phase III trials was the correct and necessary decision.  \\n\\nUnfortunately, however, we did not initiate concurrent parallel clinical trials in immunocompromised patients. That left this next round of trials for the vaccine makers or other philanthropic or government entities to \u201cpick up\u201d and conduct.  \\n\\nThis lack of foresight has impaired our knowledge of the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines among immunocompromised people. It brings us to the current state, in which the information we have on vaccination in organ transplant and cancer patients is an anecdotal collection of small studies showing that vaccines seem to be safe but, as predicted, elicit reduced levels of immune responses.  \\n\\nThe data we have on organ transplant patients who have been treated with standard drugs that deplete B cells (e.g., Rituxan) and high-dose chemotherapy all tell us that at best 50% of persons develop detectable antibodies after two doses of mRNA vaccines. Having detectable antibodies is a good sign, but we have very sensitive tools that can detect very small concentrations of antibodies. Few of these patients are generating the kind of robust concentrations of neutralizing antibodies that immunocompetent persons are typically able to generate, and which are thought to be necessary to protect against moderate to severe COVID-19.  \\n\\nIn many populations like these, where B cell depletion occurs, the percentage of persons with detectable levels of neutralizing antibodies is 20 to 25% at best. Little is known of memory T-cell responses in immunocompromised persons. This is an important area for further research, as T-cell responses could provide an important clue into whether the vaccines provide protection that lasts for the long term.  \\n\\nThe main problem right now is that there are no data to indicate if the level of immunity reduces infection or, more importantly, if these immune responses are good enough to protect these individuals from hospitalization from severe COVID-19.  \\n\\nThis is concerning because when immunosuppressed persons get infected with SARS-CoV-2, they frequently get prolonged, persistent infection. Case reports show patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection persisting for 200 days. During that time, the virus is replicating inside them, creating ample opportunity for variants to emerge. These variants often have the characteristic mutational changes associated with variants of concern. There is suggestive evidence that both the Alpha and Beta strains initially emanated from immunosuppressed patients.  \\n\\nLike COVID-19 in immunocompetent persons, the spectrum of illness in immunosuppressed patients is wide. The immunosuppressed patient can be asymptomatic \u2013 or mildly symptomatic \u2013 and transmit to family and friends and then introduce the variant into the community. Or they can have progressive longstanding pneumonia with prolonged shedding of the virus. Thus, we have a twofold difficulty. It\u2019s not good that we can\u2019t protect the most medically vulnerable from getting COVID-19, and if they do get infected, they are at risk of progressive pneumonia as well as transmitting these variants to their loved ones and communities.  \\n\\nSARS-CoV-2 as a pathogen shows no beneficence or mercy to the vulnerable.  \\n\\nSo, we truly need to find solutions here. Can we develop a vaccination regimen that works? Should we give immunosuppressed individuals neutralizing antibodies for prevention, to give them some degree of temporary protection while we vaccinate as many people in the wider population as possible? What about giving them genetically engineered neutralizing antibodies, plus giving them a vaccine to help them mount their own immune response? How about trying vaccination or boosters first and if that doesn\u2019t work, use long-acting monoclonals for those patients where vaccination has failed?  \\n\\nVaccinating patients\u2019 loved ones and households certainly is important. And hospitals that care for immunosuppressed persons need to make sure their employees are vaccinated to reduce variant spread.  \\n\\nYes, in this author\u2019s opinion, there should be mandatory vaccination for hospital employees.  \\n\\nThese studies I\u2019m proposing not only need to be about the immune responses to the vaccines as we\u2019ve conducted in other studies, but also about studies of immunosuppressed persons globally where we can evaluate not only clinical efficacy but breakthrough shedding. Does vaccination eliminate the virus from the nose? If so, then how do new variants emerge? These studies will be a bit more onerous to run than the original Phase III trials, as we\u2019ll need to collect nasal samples on a daily basis to answer this question about viral transmission from the nose. Today, we are we vaccinating cancer and organ transplant patients, but without any assurance that they are well protected. Do we know that two-dose inoculation will afford them the same amount of protection as the rest of their families and communities? The answer is no.  \\n\\nCan vaccinated immunocompromised persons, like the rest of the vaccinated population, take off their masks in most public spaces and move freely throughout their days with greater peace of mind? The answer is, we\u2019re not sure.  \\n\\nThese are all questions we need to answer for a population that is not trivial \u2013 either in significance or in number. In the U.S., there are 16 million people living with cancer and at least 1 million organ/bone marrow transplant patients. These are real issues to many U.S. and global citizens, their families, and communities.  \\n\\nWe in the medical and scientific community owe them real answers.\\n","legacyIsNew":false,"isDrafted":null,"order":0,"date":"06/30/21","attachments":[],"verticals":[],"authors":["larry-corey"]},{"id":87,"slug":"grassroots-fervor-for-large-scale-data-collaboration","meta":{"path":"/pandemic-data-initiative/news/grassroots-fervor-for-large-scale-data-collaboration","title":"Grassroots Fervor for Large-Scale Data Collaboration","description":"Red tape, limited resources, and a system that rewards isolation hindered collaborative efforts for COVID-19 research and clinical trials.","image":"/images/assets/PDI_ogburn_a259d592a7.jpg"},"section":"Expert Insight","title":"Grassroots Fervor for Large-Scale Data Collaboration","subtitle":null,"caption":"Collaboration is key to scientific and medical research. However, there were many obstacles for collaboration on COVID-19 studies that resulted in fragmented data collection and redundant studies asking the same questions.","content":"Collaboration is one of the greatest strengths of the scientific community; however, the COVID-19 pandemic exposed multiple obstacles to it, from bureaucratic red tape to academic self-interest. Dr. Betsy Ogburn, a professor of biostatistics in the Bloomberg School of Public Health and founder of the [COVID-19 Collaboration Platform](https://covidcp.org/), reflects on the academic and policy environments surrounding COVID-19 research and draws a road map for ensuring improved collaborative data efforts in the future.  \\n\\n### How does data from clinical trials benefit from aggregation?  \\n\\nAggregating data across clinical trials is important for several reasons. Many clinical trials are not powered for the question of interest, especially with novel medical treatments\u2014or even a novel disease!\u2014where you don\u2019t know what kind of effect size you\u2019re looking for. It\'s a general policy not to perform underpowered trials, but it happens all the time. So most clinical trials are too small to answer the questions they\'re trying to answer, and aggregating data across multiple trials increases the sample size and gives us more reliable information about the scientific questions of interest.  \\n\\nThe second reason is that aggregating data across trials that are answering the same scientific question reduces the probability of false positives. The global scientific community was trying to answer the same questions at the same time, especially at the beginning of the pandemic. At one point there were dozens of trials across the globe that were all trying to figure out if hydroxychloroquine was an effective treatment for COVID-19. With standard statistics, even if each one of those trials were adequately powered, you would expect five out of 100 trials to give you a false positive, and those are the studies that are going to be published while the other 95 \u201cfailed\u201d trials are relegated to a file drawer. Analyzing these parallel trials in tandem reduces the possibility of false positives.  \\n\\n> \u201cIf you aggregate data, you are more likely to be able to support detailed questions and conclusions.\u201d  \\n\\nAnother benefit of aggregating data across many trials is that you can get a more diverse and  representative sample. With aggregated data from many trials, you will likely be able to generalize conclusions to more populations of interest and ask more refined scientific questions to drill down into demographic or disease-related subgroups. Researchers often try to drill down using data from a single trial, but it\u2019s rare that a single trial would have adequate sample size for such analyses and there\u2019s always the risk of fishing for signals and finding false positives.  \\n\\n### What barriers to robust data sharing did the COVID-19 Collaboration Platform identify?  \\n\\nI stand by the idea behind the COVID-19 Collaboration Platform, but we faced so many challenges getting researchers to share their data. We have aggregated data for three research questions, which is a success, but not nearly the impact I had hoped for. From that work, I have identified three major barriers to collaboration: logistical hurdles, effort conservation, and perverse incentives to not share data. Logistical hurdles encompass the bureaucratic red tape at all institutional and government levels. Even without that red tape, it would still take extra effort to share data from all COVID-19 clinical trials, and researchers were spread too thin\u2014especially during the early months of the pandemic, when the PIs of many clinical trials were also the front-line medical workers treating COVID patients. Those two issues are somewhat surmountable in the future.  \\n\\nHowever, incentives in the academic research setting align against sharing data. Since the most valuable research output is a first-author paper, it\'s self-sacrificial to forgo that authorship for the benefit of public health and contribute data to a bigger project where you are one of maybe hundreds of authors. That sacrifice has ripple effects through researchers\u2019 careers, especially young researchers. It makes it harder to get grants to fund your research in the future if you don\'t go after first-author publications. It makes it harder to get your future papers published. It makes it harder to get promoted within your institution.  \\n\\n> \u201cIn public health, the core purpose of research is to save lives and the incentives are aligned against that very outcome.\u201d  \\n\\n### How do we fix the system to promote collaboration and improved research?  \\n\\nIt\'s a collective action problem that I am not equipped to solve. I think funding organizations should change the way they evaluate the outputs from research. It would be pretty easy to create systems that evaluate funded research on how much it contributed to public health, as opposed to how much it contributed to first-author publications. The government\u2019s answer to centralized clinical trial aggregation is clinicaltrials.gov, but it does not go far enough requiring funded research to be made publicly available, especially for time-sensitive medical, clinical, and public health questions.  \\n\\nData should be shared for the public good, especially if its collection was publicly funded. But incentive structures need to change so researchers can be confident that their careers won\'t suffer if they share their data instead of hoarding it for first author papers.  \\n\\n### Have there been any successes with data collection and aggregation during the pandemic?  \\n\\nThere were so many grassroot successes, including the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. There were academics who worked to get mobility data from tech companies and made it available for research. There were many spur-of-the-moment collaborations between municipalities, counties, and research groups. I know anecdotally of a group of researchers who didn\u2019t sleep for a week so they could build a predictive model for hospital capacity for a county Department of Health. Most of the failures are at a higher level with the bodies that should be in charge of making sure that disparate research efforts coordinate with one another to get the general population the best possible information. As we look to the future, my feeling is that there needs to be a top down effort to coordinate research for global public health emergencies; bottom up efforts won\u2019t cut it.  \\n","legacyIsNew":false,"isDrafted":null,"order":0,"date":"07/21/21","attachments":["/images/assets/PDI_ogburn_a259d592a7.jpg"],"verticals":["pandemic-data-initiative"],"authors":["joshua-e-porterfield-ph-d"]},{"id":68,"slug":"providing-public-data-during-global-health-crises","meta":{"path":"/pandemic-data-initiative/news/providing-public-data-during-global-health-crises","title":"Q&A: Providing Public Data During Global Health Crises","description":"Lauren Gardner of the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 Dashboard discusses improving pandemic data collection and reporting in the United States and around the world","image":"/images/assets/PDI_LG_6_2_21_1556e7b890.jpg"},"section":"Expert Insight","title":"Q&A: Providing Public Data During Global Health Crises","subtitle":null,"caption":"Dr. Lauren Gardner explains the difficulties in acquiring public health data during the COVID-19 pandemic and gives her perspective on how public health data systems should be maintained and democratized moving forward.","content":"Dr. Lauren Gardner, director of the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins, had worked with public health data systems related to infectious disease outbreaks for many years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. She and her team built the [COVID-19 global map](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) that is the keystone of the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. Governments, media outlets, and members of the public from around the globe have used the map to make data-driven decisions throughout the pandemic. This has generated an extremely high-value public health data set, which Dr. Gardner and the CRC have made publicly available to help inform and engage the global community during this crisis. Challenges in gathering the data have made it clear that everyone involved in public health must band together to maintain newly established data ties and build a stronger data infrastructure in anticipation of the next major crisis.  \\n\\n### How does data reported and collected for previous outbreaks compare with COVID-19 data?  \\n\\nThe challenges that we faced this pastyear with data collection efforts are not specific to COVID-19 at all. I\'ve been working with infectious disease data for over a decade, and this whole field is really data poor, especially in the emerging stages of an outbreak. However, high quality data is imperative to be able to conduct useful  risk assessment and make evidence-based decisions in real-time. This recognized data gap is why we started the COVID-19 global dashboard effort in the first place.  \\n\\nFor measles, in particular, we had a lot of similar challenges. We wanted to know where measles outbreaks were happening and where there were likely to be new hotspots. However there was no centralized data set of measles cases available for the US at the county or state level. We had to go around state by state to collect the data ourselves from many disparate sources.  \\n\\n> \u2018The main challenge is that there is no consistent standardized reporting by states.\u2019  \\n\\nFurthermore, when we do these data collection efforts, they aren\u2019t transferable because there is no systematic way the data is provided. Therefore, when we want to update our risk models (say for future years), we have to go around and re-collect all the same data, for a different year;  which is essentially starting from scratch.  For COVID-19, states are currently providing data in a better format than for measles with designated webpages and dashboards, but I\'m not optimistic that these will become standing data infrastructures moving forward.  \\n\\n### Throughout the pandemic state dashboards provided daily updates, but some states are now opting to release data with less regularity. What issues will arise with a lower frequency of data reporting?  \\n\\nIt\u2019s not the time to slow things down. The states should be using this experience as an opportunity to build sustainable infrastructures that can continue to provide data at more regular intervals moving forward. However, they seem to be doing the opposite. Concerningly, when states shift from daily to weekly reporting it is harder to  compare them with states that are continuing to release updates every day. They think that they\'re rounding out this experience and closing down shop, but COVID is so far from over in so many parts of the world. With the borders opening and so much transmission still happening, there is still a substantial risk posed within and to the US. States that shut down reporting will eventually have to rebuild and start up again, either when COVID-19 flares up or when there\'s another pandemic or other public health crisis. States definitely need to be moving towards a more reliable and consistent reporting infrastructure, rather than scaling back.  \\n\\n> \u2018Slowing down data reporting makes our data quality poorer.\u2019  \\n\\n### Why did you make the global map\u2019s data set free for everyone to access?  \\n\\nIt is inappropriate to sell public health data during a public health crisis. We never considered monetizing this data. We collected this data so it could be made available to anyone that needed it to make better decisions, reduce harm, and mitigate risk.  \\n\\nAt first, the data was open for use by education, public health, and research institutions, but it was restricted from for-profit applications by corporations. However, early in 2020 we relaxed those requirements and opened it up for anyone to use for any application with an attribution license. We did this because there were many one-off for-profit use cases proposed to us, such as planning office re-openings, that we felt were justified uses of the data, and giving permission one at a time. This approach bothered me since smaller organizations couldn\u2019t be heard with their requests for special case uses. This is why we opened up the license.  \\n\\n### What have you learned over this past year observing the creation and expansion of a new public health data infrastructure?  \\n\\nIt should never have to be done this way again. The type of data we collected and shared clearly needs to exist, but it cannot be provided by building a system from scratch in real time. There needs to be an infrastructure in place that systematically centralizes data, and required reporting standards to complement it. Then, when new viruses emerge, they can be easily incorporated into these standing systems that are centralized, democratized, and public.  \\n\\nAn additional thing I learned was the hunger for information from the general public. We built the global tracking map thinking that our small research community of infectious disease modelers would love to have access to this type of data. We never foresaw how much it would be valued and relied upon by the general public.  \\n\\n> \u2018There\u2019s a hunger for data, and it should be democratized.

The data they provide have led to major policy decisions across all levels of government and influenced the behavior and decisions of many Americans. Due in large part to these efforts, test positivity rates are now dramatically decreasing across the country. In response to decreasing case numbers, many states (highlighted on the map below) have begun to slow their reporting cadences. While lower numbers are cause for measured optimism, we urge officials to stay the course of daily reporting, and not allow their data to go \u201cstale\u201d by releasing it infrequently. For more than a year, CRC experts encouraged daily reporting from states instead of weekly reporting <sup>1</sup>. Now that we are finally winning the battle against COVID-19, we cannot stop fighting. **This virus is not going away.**\\n\\n![Frequency-Update-PDI-Blog-0608.jpg]()\\n\\nReal-time public health data is the most powerful weapon against a pandemic <sup>2, 3</sup>. Temporal sensitivity of data is analogous to resolution in a photograph. Take the following image for instance:\\n\\n![Cheetah-Pixelation-opt.jpg]()\\n\\nThe image on the left is full resolution. Though camouflaged, you can still see the cheetahs lurking in the center of the frame. The photograph on the right has seven-fold lower resolution\u2014the same transformation that would take place if states transitioned from daily to once-weekly reporting. The general understanding of the landscape remains the same, but the lack of resolution prevents us from identifying specific risks that require immediate action.\\nThis concept of resolution is applicable to data sourced from state COVID-19 dashboards. An example pulled directly from the data by scientists at the JHU Coronavirus Resource Center involves hospitalizations in Michigan. Hospitalization data has one of the highest resolutions in the realm of COVID-19 data due to standardized data reporting methods mandated by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services <sup>4</sup>. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services releases the hospitalization data it receives from the states daily <sup>5</sup>.  \\n\\nThe daily reporting of data (solid blue line on the graph below) allowed for early identification of the shift in trends in mid-March 2021 by news outlets and hospitals <sup>6-8</sup>. This fine temporal resolution gave government and public health officials within Michigan, including Governor Gretchen Whitmer <sup>9</sup>, time to respond to the new outbreak before it overtook levels last seen in fall 2020. This quick action allowed the federal government time to mobilize additional COVID-19 vaccine doses as well as over 200 federal personnel to aid in distribution of the vaccines <sup>10</sup>.  \\n\\n![Michigan Hospitalizations.png]()  \\n*Hospitalization data from the [U.S. Department of Health and Human Services](https://healthdata.gov/Hospital/COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa/g62h-syeh)  \\n\\nIf data had only been provided with one-week resolution (red bars on the graph above), then the trend shift is not necessarily clear until later. By March 20th the daily data was already showing 1500 daily hospitalizations, while the most recent weekly data point was still at 1000 hospitalizations, thus inadvertently ignoring the exponential growth for days. This would have resulted in a delay in the identification of the increase in cases, the request of Governor Whitmer for federal aid, and the full response of the U.S. government. The JHU [Coronavirus Resource Center policy tracker](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/state-timeline/new-confirmed-cases/michigan) also shows that the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services extended its Gatherings and Mask epidemic order on April 16 in response to accelerating case numbers. Without timely data, policy decisions such as these can be delayed, leading to more unnecessary deaths from COVID-19.  \\n\\nPublic health data scientists would prefer all data to have the resolution of this hospitalization data. Maintaining daily reporting will be necessary to ongoing virus tracking efforts and mitigation of the COVID-19 pandemic, which makes state rollback of data reporting extremely concerning. Some states have argued that the dashboards are no longer necessary since the CDC tracks pandemic data. While the CDC does aggregate COVID-19 data, it is important to note that the CDC is limited to using data filed through official reporting channels, which are not publicly available. This can result in a serious reporting lag as well as data discrepancies when state updates are out of sync with official federal channels.  \\n\\nIf states decide to roll back their COVID-19 dashboards, then the nation\u2019s ability to respond and react quickly to the continuing pandemic will be seriously impeded. The rollback of reporting frequency indicates that many states do not see this past year of investment in data infrastructure and public data reporting as a permanent fixture. It is crucial that we maintain the infrastructure developed during the pandemic, both to monitor the continued spread of COVID-19 and safeguard against future public health crises. States signaling that they want to treat the COVID-19 response like the responses to previous pandemics \u2013 a temporary fix that doesn\u2019t prioritize planning for the next crisis \u2013 is unacceptable. We are positioned to prepare our data infrastructure for future threats, and we cannot let states choose to dismantle that costly and crucial investment.  \\n\\n---  \\n\\nReferences:  \\n1. C.

At the time, he was describing how HSV-2 increased the risk of HIV acquisition and HIV made the severity of HSV-2 worse, and how this relationship between the two conditions created an epidemiological synergy with concomitant additional misery for humankind. This title is applicable today about the intersecting pandemics of HIV and COVID-19.  \\n\\nIndividuals living with HIV have a degree of immunosuppression that varies based on their therapy and disease course. If the disease course is well controlled and fully virologically suppressed on antiretroviral therapy, there is evidence to believe that these patients are at a normal risk of acquiring and controlling COVID-19, much like others in their families and communities. This analogy is partially accurate in that those living with HIV can, because of their medicines, have obesity, diabetes, and increased lung disease, which are all predispositions or comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19.  \\n\\nImportantly, there are subsets of persons living with HIV \u2013 including those who are immune deficient with low T cell counts, those with viremia due to drug resistant HIV viral strains, those not receiving or not taking antiretroviral therapy, and the many millions we know are living with undiagnosed HIV infection, including those recently infected. These persons are subject to acquire persistent, prolonged SARS-CoV-2 infection, akin to organ transplant recipients and severely immunosuppressed cancer patients. There are many causes of immunocompromise but in many countries HIV infection is among the most common. A recent [case report](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.03.21258228) by Karim et al. from South Africa, the country with the largest percent of the population living with HIV, described a case of HIV infection in a person who had very low CD4 counts due to resistant virus and a lack of compliance who developed COVID-19. Over a period of 200 days, this patient \u2013 who was ambulatory, living in the community, and without serious symptoms \u2013 shed SARS-CoV-2. They had mild illness early on, which is why they were observed, and because of HIV, follow-up care ensued. The investigators had samples from the patient, and they shed SARS-CoV-2 at high titers, showing the development of multi-mutational changes in the virus over time. These mutational changes essentially recapitulated the Beta variant, which has 9 to 11 different mutational changes than the original ancestral strain. This case illustrates why we are writing this blog to talk about how individual patients living with HIV and compromised immune systems who have this prolonged shedding pattern can result in the kind of mutational changes that lead to germination and spread of variants of concern in our communities.  \\n\\nThis case is illustrative because it\u2019s not rare. It\u2019s illustrative because out of the estimated 38 million people living with HIV worldwide, South Africa alone has more than 16 million citizens, or 25%, of its 65 million people living with HIV. So okay, the two epidemics are intertwined, what\u2019s the concern? Well, the concern is that these people will suffer more serious COVID-19 cases and that they may serve as the potential unwitting source of new variants through household and community contacts.  \\n\\nAs the greatest population of persons living with HIV is in sub-Saharan Africa, where vaccination rates are currently less than 2% of the populace, this continual reservoir of variant generation is and should be of concern to all of us. We need to recognize that we do not have a demonstrably effective vaccine against COVID-19 among persons living with HIV. The data that we have from the Novavax study in South Africa showed absolutely no efficacy against COVID-19. In the Ensemble Johnson & Johnson (J&J) study, too few cases were acquired to adequately evaluate the effectiveness of the one-dose J&J vaccine. And in the Moderna trial, no cases of COVID-19 were reported in the 150 HIV+ recipients who received vaccination. The reason for the lack of efficacy of the Novavax vaccine is bothersome as the post-vaccination binding antibody titers were well above natural infection and in the range associated with reasonable efficacy (median 33,000).  \\n\\nSo, what\u2019s going on here? The answer is, we don\u2019t know the reason for lack of effectiveness, but we do know that the mRNA vaccines offer the most immediate solution to this major hole in the public health control of SARS-CoV-2 variants. The data suggest that we need to take our most potent vaccines \u2013 mRNA or perhaps two doses of the J&J vaccine or a heterologous prime boost with one of the vaccines being an mRNA vaccine \u2013 into areas of the world where there are high burdens of HIV and COVID-19 co-circulating. We need to urgently take steps to evaluate if our best vaccine regimens are able to effectively prevent acquisition of COVID-19 in all persons living with HIV but especially among those with uncontrolled HIV.  \\n\\nThe tale of these two intersecting epidemics needs a better ending than what we \u2013 as a global community \u2013 are currently creating. The Delta variant epidemic is rapidly illustrating that chasing variants is not a successful strategy. The Delta variant has swept through countries like the UK, Israel, and South Africa in four to eight weeks and is the dominant variant in the United States at a speed that, even with RNA technologies, we cannot match. Our approach must be to slow down the generation of these rapidly doubling super-spreading micro-epidemics of infection among unvaccinated persons.  \\n\\nThe equation today among those unvaccinated individuals is not whether you will get COVID-19 infection but when you will get it. Slowing it down requires our best vaccine products and strategies. It\u2019s certainly not too late. But we need both studies and implementation of our most potent vaccines and vaccine regimens to be applied to all of our immunosuppressed populations, the largest of which is HIV, for us to have a globally effective strategy.\\n\\n---  \\n\\nThe authors recently published a related [article](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb2104756?query=featured_home) in the New England Journal of Medicine.","legacyIsNew":false,"isDrafted":null,"order":0,"date":"07/23/21","attachments":["/images/assets/JHU-Blog-Brand-JHUUW-02_0c03ab0ec1.jpeg"],"verticals":[],"authors":["larry-corey","chris-beyrer-md"]},{"id":78,"slug":"no-magic-number-for-herd-immunity","meta":{"path":"/vaccines/q-n-a/no-magic-number-for-herd-immunity","title":"No Magic Number for Herd Immunity","description":"Declaring success regarding the commonly misunderstood concept is not as simple as the public believes.","image":""},"section":"Vaccines Q & A","title":"No Magic Number for Herd Immunity","subtitle":"","caption":"Declaring success regarding the commonly misunderstood concept is not as simple as the public believes.","content":"Public misperceptions about herd immunity have persisted through much of the pandemic, providing an additional reason for people to cite when refusing to get vaccinated. Yet the United States needs more people to get vaccinated, not fewer, because vaccination rates have stagnated just as the more highly transmissible Delta variant is spreading. Just because others are vaccinated does not protect the unvaccinated from infection. Israel outpaced the world for weeks in getting nearly 58% of its citizens fully vaccinated by July. Yet the nation and others are imposing new restrictions due to outbreaks driven by the Delta variant.  \\n \\n### What is missing from the public\u2019s perception of herd immunity?  \\n\\n\u2018Herd immunity\u2019 is one of the terms that epidemiologists have used for years that the public suddenly has become aware of. The public perception is sometimes that there\u2019s this magic threshold that we need to hit, that there\u2019s a specific target \u2013 and that at that point we\u2019re done, we\u2019re safe, and life is normal again.  \\n\\nBut that is an oversimplification.  \\n\\nThis is something we have struggled with as epidemiologists even before the pandemic because we use a concept of herd immunity that assumes homogeneity \u2013 which essentially means we assume people behave like particles and that every single particle can bounce into every other particle in a population. We calculate a herd immunity threshold based off of what we think the transmissibility of a given pathogen is in a certain area. But that doesn\u2019t work as cleanly as everyone wants, because people don\u2019t really behave like particles \u2013 we have social networks, geographic restrictions, and age-contact patterns that all contribute to make disease transmission varied across populations.  \\n\\n> \u201cPlaces with high vaccination coverage will see continued declines in COVID-19 even with the variant\u201d\\n\\nThe message has been convoluted in that certain populations think they\u2019ve achieved herd immunity and that everything is fine and safe because they have \u201cenough\u201d vaccination or natural immunity. But in reality, we have pockets of susceptibility and pockets of immunity. And with a global pathogen, the potential for reintroduction into those susceptible pockets is high and will continue to persist for a long time.  \\n  \\n### Is herd immunity more easily calculated for smaller regions than for entire nations?  \\n\\nThere are many different factors that can contribute to reaching a point at which enough immunity exists in a certain population to interrupt disease transmission. Is the population in a city or a rural area? What\u2019s the  vaccination level? How frequently do people interact with each other? How connected is your population to others? Some people are in contact with a lot of people. Some people are in contact with few people. Some people have more contact with the most susceptible people than others do.\\n\\nWe have done [work in the past with measles](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6348711/) highlighting how the degree to which susceptible individuals cluster together will quantitatively increase the herd immunity threshold.  \\n\\nThe amount of variability in these factors across a country or even state makes calculating an accurate herd immunity threshold extremely challenging. And even for smaller populations, like in counties, prescribing a single, concise threshold target would likely be inaccurate.  \\n\\nHerd immunity should really be thought of as a gradient, a range of immunity at which we expect to see declines in transmission, but not where transmission risk ends completely and immediately. But we also need to remember that even this gradient can move with a changing pathogen. We are seeing this now with the increase of the Delta variant in the U.S.  \\n\\n### What do projections about the virus tell us about herd immunity?  \\n\\nSome of our U.S. simulations reveal a divide between locations. For places with high vaccination coverage, we are projecting continued declines, even with the Delta variant. For other places there is the potential for increases in cases and deaths because there is insufficient immunity, particularly from vaccination.  \\n\\n> \u201cOutbreaks will continue in states with lower vaccination coverage\u201d  \\n\\nIt\'s even more complicated as new variants emerge that we had not captured in our projections.  \\n\\nThe projections we conduct for the [COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub](https://covid19scenariomodelinghub.org/viz.html) estimate expected cases, deaths, and hospitalizations over the next six months in the United States. These projections attempt to account for what we know about the virus and the pandemic at the time at which each round of projections is produced. This includes: \\n\\n1. The increasing transmissibility coming from more infectious variants (e.g.,  Delta variant)  \\n2. Current vaccination coverage levels  \\n3. Expected vaccination coverage levels based on hesitancy and saturation  \\n4. Natural immunity from past infections  \\n5. Control measures and behavior from the past and what is expected in the future (i.e., non-pharmaceutical interventions).  \\n\\nThe projections do not explicitly detail herd immunity, but they do speak to it, and the challenges of reaching it. The projections provide a glimpse into the complexity of herd immunity.  \\n\\nIn a high transmissibility scenario, some states are expected to have substantial resurgences, others not at all. This demonstrates how some are reaching herd immunity at a broad scale. They may have continued cases, including clusters, but won\u2019t be seeing the outbreaks that other states with lower vaccination coverage and natural immunity are expected to have.  \\n\\nWith each new more transmissible variant, the level of immunity required to interrupt transmission and reach herd immunity increases.  \\n \\n### What is most worrisome about the plateau in U.S. vaccination rates?  \\n\\nWe expect to see a slowdown in vaccinations as more and more people get vaccinated. When we started, we were targeting the people who were most at risk and they were willing to get vaccinated early. Now I think we have a large portion of the population that is being very casual about getting vaccinated, saying they\u2019ll get to it eventually. They\'re not necessarily against vaccination, but they\'re just not prioritizing it or they\'re waiting for full approval from the Food and Drug Administration. For a variety of reasons, others have been waiting for authorization of vaccines like Novavax, which use a different mechanism. I was a little surprised that we stagnated as early as we did with vaccinations, but hopefully, concerns about variants will compel more people to get vaccinated.

Her expertise has been integral to all efforts at the Coronavirus Resource Center, particularly tracking COVID-19 testing and positivity rates. Dr. Nuzzo shared her thoughts regarding public health data during this pandemic and what she hopes will be an expanded role for public health officials and data scientists in the future. She believes that they should serve as a first line of defense against future health crises and receive the significant investment their roles deserve.  \\n\\n### Do you believe that public health data infrastructure needs to be maintained as opposed to shut down after the pandemic?  \\n\\nI seriously hope it is something that we continue to try to improve upon. I was disheartened to read, during this pandemic, that some places are still piecing together and faxing Excel sheets to record and transmit data. Local public health data infrastructure is the foundation of our national health surveillance capability. We must not only improve their technology, but also their data analytics capabilities. The level of data science demonstrated by the CRC is not available in all places, but it should be. This is the future of public health \u2013 big data.  \\n\\n> \u2018As much as we need laboratories and epidemiologists, we need people who can handle data.\u2019  \\n\\nThe challenge is that there\'s a tremendous amount of money on the table, and my hope is that it can actually be used to make some long-term basic infrastructure changes. When a large pot of money becomes available it often goes to buy one-time cost items as opposed to the continued support of people. Think of it like this: We fund and maintain the military for the defense of the country. We\'re now seeing the consequences of not having standing public health defenses. We need to think of our public health professionals as our first line of defense against health crises.  \\n\\n### How concerned are you regarding many states\u2019 decisions to reduce how frequently and how much data they release to the public?  \\n\\nThe first thing that we started to see was a number of states not reporting on the weekends, and that number has increased over time, which makes it harder to detect trends. Over Memorial Day weekend, the media and even some government officials tweeted that the United States had the lowest number of COVID-19 cases reported in a very long time. On any given weekend, almost half of states don\'t report data. If you look at weekend numbers, you would think that we\'re doing well, but the numbers represent cases from only about half of the states.  \\n\\nWe may soon be moving towards weekly reports from states. That makes it difficult to identify trends, because you don\'t know until the next week if you\'re in trouble. With a decreasing frequency of reports we start to lose insights, and it compromises our abilities to spot problems early. That level of resolution becomes increasingly important (hyperlink to data frequency blog) because small changes have big consequences as case numbers continue to shrink.  \\n\\n### Are you worried about state rollback of testing capacity in addition to data reporting frequency?  \\n\\nWe do have fewer infections now, but there has been a rollback of testing even prior to this latest decrease. Testing numbers were plateauing around Thanksgiving, even as the country was headed into its biggest surge of cases ever. As states were preparing to roll out vaccines, they simply switched their testing centers over to vaccine centers. When you reduce testing capacity like that, you begin sampling a different population since the reduced geographic network of testing centers prevents many people from getting tested. Now, due to the difficulty in getting a COVID-19 test, most people getting tested are those who need a negative test result for school, work, or travel. As we have dialed back on testing and have less frequent reporting of cases, we\'re starting to point our telescope at a different place in the sky, and we might not be seeing an oncoming meteor.  \\n\\n### What is the role of testing and public health data moving forward?  \\n\\nI fundamentally reject any idea that we won\'t need data as the case numbers decline. The types of data and how we use them are going to change. Testing remains essential. Testing is the start of the process by which we conduct our surveillance of COVID-19. The way that we are going to test is going to change.  \\n\\n> \u2018All data remain essential.\u2019  \\n\\nWe\'re not going to eradicate this virus from the planet. I see us continuing to test people with COVID-19 symptoms because there could be dangers, including genetic variants, that we need to spot. The way that we spot new problems is by testing people. While we may start dialing back on the mass testing, that doesn\'t mean that we\'re not going to do more targeted testing and surveillance testing.  \\n\\n### As COVID-19 testing becomes more targeted, what is the role and format of the data from that testing?  \\n\\nI wish we had more real-time surveillance for all diseases and conditions. I once spent some time at Taiwan\u2019s CDC and I was so amazed by how they put their notifiable diseases and conditions up online in near real time. By comparison, our system where states collect these data, look at them on their own, and don\'t publish them until they\'re vetted, sometimes years later in a summary report, is not effective. It is critical for public health to continue to remind the public what it does and to put those data out there for all to see, to build that trust and transparency.  \\n\\nWe should not dial back this public health data infrastructure. It is important that we continue to collect information, conduct surveillance, and ask questions that can help us better understand this and other viruses - the ones that we know now and the ones that are yet to come.\\n","legacyIsNew":false,"isDrafted":null,"order":35,"date":"06/09/21","attachments":["/images/assets/PDI_JN_6_9_21_8d4c00f926.jpg"],"verticals":["pandemic-data-initiative"],"authors":["joshua-e-porterfield-ph-d"]},{"id":79,"slug":"johns-hopkins-launches-online-chatbot-to-answer-vaccine-questions","meta":{"path":"/vaccines/q-n-a/johns-hopkins-launches-online-chatbot-to-answer-vaccine-questions","title":"Johns Hopkins Launches Online \u2018Chatbot\u2019 To Answer Vaccine Questions","description":"\u2018Vira, the Vax Chatbot\u2019 Designed To Help Address Lagging Vaccinations Among Young People","image":"/images/assets/vira_cf8538b01a.jpg"},"section":"Vaccines Q & A","title":"Johns Hopkins Launches Online \u2018Chatbot\u2019 To Answer Vaccine Questions","subtitle":null,"caption":"*\u2018Vira, the Vax Chatbot\u2019 Designed To Help Address Lagging Vaccinations Among Young People*","content":"Visit [VaxChat.org](http://vaxchat.org/) and an animated ball with two eyes and two teeth will greet you with a wide smile and the ability to answer pretty much any question about COVID-19 vaccines.  \\n\\nMeet \u201c[Vira, the Vax Chatbot](http://vaxchat.org/),\u201d an online artificial intelligence tool designed by the Johns Hopkins [International Vaccine Access Center](https://www.jhsph.edu/ivac/) and IBM Research to provide quick and simple answers to vaccination inquiries.  \\n\\nWith COVID-19 vaccinations lagging in young adults across the United States, researchers built Vira to offer around-the-clock access to the vast vaccine intelligence from experts in the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.  \\n\\nVira\u2019s design was assisted by scientists from the Bloomberg School\u2019s Department of International Health and the Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering.

My co-panelists were: [Dr. Letitia Dzirasa](https://health.baltimorecity.gov/senior-staff/dr-letitia-dzirasa), Baltimore City\u2019s health commissioner; [Amanda Daflos](https://civicimpact.jhu.edu/), inaugural executive director of the Bloomberg Center for Public Innovation at Johns Hopkins and former chief innovation officer for Los Angeles; and [Dr. Joshua Sharfstein](https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/1781/joshua-m-sharfstein), vice dean for public health practice and community engagement at the Bloomberg School of Public Health. During the forum, these panelists shared their thoughts about how data played a key role in the COVID-19 pandemic and hopes for the future use of data to address public health concerns.  \\n\\nDr. Dzirasa first discussed how, throughout the pandemic, data has become more readily available than ever. The way data permeated pop culture, she said, was something that had never been seen on this scale. Because of this widespread availability, public health officials on all levels have had a heightened responsibility to communicate data to the public in a manner that is easily understood. Dr. Dzirasa detailed the role of data in developing a vaccination distribution plan for Baltimore built upon a framework of equity. When discussing Baltimore City\u2019s COVID-19 dashboard, she highlighted how data has directly influenced policy and subsequent action by providing real-time updates on the lowest and highest vaccination rate areas.  \\n\\nAmanda Daflos shared her experience developing local data collection efforts in Los Angeles that were used daily during the city-wide mayoral briefings. This data collection not only helped to identify patterns within the pandemic, but also helped to build the public\u2019s trust in government and was used to help drive policies such as the mask mandate. She emphasized the need for robust demographic data to best identify high-risk populations and tailor local government\u2019s response to the pandemic\u2019s ever-changing landscape.  \\n\\nDr. Sharfstein stated that the biggest challenge throughout the pandemic was getting people\u2019s attention and that the JHU Coronavirus Resource Center did just that. He talked about Maryland\u2019s ambitious vaccination distribution plan and how it initially failed to equitably distribute vaccines.  data was eventually released, it showed that vaccine distribution was skewed with three-fold differences between some Maryland counties. The state then made a series of policy changes to address those distribution discrepancies. This experience shows that while real-time data is critical to shaping policy, it is also essential for reviewing past efforts to improve the future outcomes. He emphasized that while access to data can help slowly build up trust among the public, the lack of trust in government and science made it difficult to fully take advantage of data availability and engage the public.  \\n\\nDuring the highly engaing Q&A, when asked about the trends related to sex and race in COVID-19 data, Dr. Dzirasa pointed out that at the beginning of the pandemic, the data revealed a four-fold increase of cases in the Latinx community over the white community in Baltimore. This led the city to start a mobile testing service, catering specifically to this at-risk population. ata allowed the government to allocate resources where necessary. She explained that identifying demographic disparities via data, as opposed to ignoring them, can empower local governments to tailor their response and directly help people in greatest need.  \\n\\nTo gather COVID-19 data within transient populations, Ms. Daflos shared that street teams were sent out around Los Angeles with information on COVID-related resources and services. Zip code data was used to find the areas with the highest transient concentrations, which were then prioritized for vaccination distribution. Data was the key to understanding the transient population and enabled Los Angeles to track cases and set up quarantine hotels and vaccination centers to better service them.  \\n\\nGiven new practices with using robust data since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, I observed that it is now much easier to get a granular geographical analysis on data sets which would normally have intense lag. New data practices will also test local governments on their capacity to lend support and aid based on their findings, whether it concerns climate change, city resource accessibility, student services, or other issues. There are many ways that data can be leveraged to get to the root of systemic challenges.  \\n\\nCOVID-19 has shown us that it is possible to lead with data, but the infrastructure needs to be strengthened and utilized to its full potential. Dr. Sharfstein added that various data types have different implications and different sources have different relevance, as some are harder to get than others and some data is used not enough or too much. We have many data streams, but they don\u2019t often have the ability to cross-reference each other and oftentimes we aren\u2019t fully aware of what data is out there to use.  \\n\\nI am excited to have the input of these incredible panelists as the Pandemic Data Initiative continues to consider the future of public health data policy and responses to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

This data is not provided to local governments and the public in a uniform, detailed manner, which makes it impossible to know how COVID-19 is differently affecting the diverse populations in our nation.\\n","content":"Throughout our work at the CRC, we have highlighted that state reporting methods for COVID-19 [testing](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/pandemic-data-initiative/news/q-and-a-securing-our-national-public-health-defense), [hospitalization](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/pandemic-data-initiative/news/we-need-a-daily-data-dump), death, and [vaccination](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/pandemic-data-initiative/news/covid-19-vaccine-doses-delivery-demand-and-data) data are limited by lack of standardization and accessibility. These challenges only worsen when the data is broken into a dizzying number of demographic subcategories. Further complicating the matter, states often only provide demographic data in an aggregated form, preventing local governments and the public from accessing detailed demographic information for their areas.  \\n\\n### Why is demographic data important?  \\n\\nWith access to detailed demographic data, local governments would be equipped to design targeted outreach programs and deploy mobile vaccination units to locate and assist their most vulnerable residents. This information would also inform policy decisions of city and county leaders by more accurately identifying hotspots, opportunities to invest in public health assets and track outbreaks in near real-time. Additionally, because COVID-19 is still a relatively new virus, making detailed demographic data publicly available would help the scientific community better understand how the virus spreads and which people are most impacted by infection. This could help with the design of new therapies and better prepare public health professionals for future viruses and variants.  \\n\\n### What are the problems?  \\n\\nThere are two major issues with COVID-19 demographic data:  \\n\\n1. Detailed demographic data from states is not accessible to the public and local governments  \\n2. Demographic categories and definitions differ between states  \\n\\nExacerbating these challenges, state demographic data is often released in the form of charts or PDF reports, which contain aggregated data, lack individual detail necessary for accurate analysis. This bare-bones, aggregated data often is stored in hard to reach places,  recorded manually in assorted reports, press releases, and even images . This manual data collection process requires significant work, unlike other data streams whose collection has been automated due to the format and accessibility of data. Release of raw, individualized COVID-19 demographic data from which the states calculate these aggregates would remove the need for manual data collection. Public release of the data would also allow county and city-level officials and public health workers to access and utilize this granular demographic information.  \\n\\nMore concerningly, the data is so disparate that it\u2019s essentially impossible to compare between states. There are no standards for categorizing demographic data, so individual decisions to label categories with similar but different names, such as \u201cHawaiian\u201d vs. \u201cHawaiian/Pacific Islander,\u201d complicate the data. There are currently 1,098 different demographic categories reported by the U.S. states and territories, which is an unmanageable quantity. This description of data disarray does not even include testing, hospitalization, or cross-categorization metrics, such as \u201cwhite women aged 30-45,\u201d which would add thousands more categories.  \\n\\nThere are even discrepancies within the same state. In Georgia, the demographic age categories on the state COVID-19 dashboard <sup>1</sup> do not match the age categories on the state vaccination dashboard <sup>2</sup>. A 60-year-old Georgia resident would be in the 60-69 age demographic group for a COVID-19 case, but in the 55-64 age group for their COVID-19 vaccination. This one person has already contributed data to two separate demographic pools, before accounting for sex, ethnicity, and race.  \\n\\n### How are these issues manifested in the data?  \\n\\nCRC data scientists have visualized the plethora of demographic categories as tree maps, an example of which is displayed below. Each box in the map represents a distinct demographic category and its size is proportional to the number of times that label is used across states.  \\n\\n![tree-charts.jpg]()  \\n\\nRacial data is the most complex and convoluted of all the demographic data even though the U.S. Office of Management and Budget only mandates five race categories <sup>3</sup>. Instead, there are over 40 unique demographic categories of race reported within state *vaccination data alone* as shown in the image above. While America is a melting pot where many people have rich, diverse ancestries, there are mathematical and scientific benefits to grouping the data into a reasonable number of consistent categories. A person who is \u201cMiddle Eastern\u201d should not become \u201cAsian\u201d when they cross one state border and \u201cWhite\u201d when they cross another. This lack of data uniformity makes race-based analysis of COVID-19 trends virtually impossible.  \\n\\n### What can we do to fix it?  \\n\\nThe good news is **the data exist**. States could release the raw data publicly to allow for better demographic analysis. The data can and should be disaggregated, randomized, individualized, and anonymized. While privacy is not of major concern in a data set this large, it is important to proactively protect individual anonymity while pursuing data analysis to protect the country. These data should be easily accessible, machine-readable, regularly updated, and centralized, so that policymakers and the public can make informed decisions and identify risks in near real-time.  \\n\\nAs the country moves forward in this pandemic and prepares for the next public health crisis, demographic categories need to be standardized. The United States does not have federal standards for public health data categorization, but state health departments could agree to follow one example, such as that of the Census Bureau or the Office of Management and Budget <sup>4, 5</sup>, which overlap and have been thoroughly vetted in a bipartisan manner. Standardizing and releasing these data streams should be a national priority.  \\n\\n---  \\n\\nReferences  \\n1. Daily Status Report, Georgia Department of Public Health, 2021.  \\n2.

In the face of a devastating and deadly pandemic we quickly marshalled leading edge data resources to help us navigate unknown territory and save lives. The most important lesson that I will take away from this work is that **we can do this**. As we continue to keep this virus at bay, I urge policy makers at all levels of government to continue this work and scale it to the entrenched social determinants of health that regularly interfere with opportunity, economic mobility, and all the promise and potential of our great country.  \\n\\nBelow is my abridged testimony, which is unavailable online with complete audio due to technical complications with some portions of the hearing.

I led an ambitious cross government data initiative that was credited with significant outcomes for residents ranging from marked reduction in infant mortality, nation leading school performance, to record low crime rates. Since 2015 I have led a center at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) focused on building the capacity of local leaders to use data to improve outcomes, and for the last 17 months, I have been the data lead for Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Coronavirus Resource Center.  \\n\\n> \u201cI have seen the very best and the very worst of data use.\u201d  \\n\\nThe bills that are the subject of today\u2019s hearing go a long way to realign federal resources with interventions that are proven, measurable, and focused on ending multigenerational health and wellbeing disparities.  \\n\\nIn the last 18 months, government at all levels did something incredibly remarkable. They built data collection efforts, shared data, and made real time decisions that were based on near time data. Never before has the nation endeavored to realize a coordinated effort around data sharing, data informed decision making, and collective outcome measurement at such scale. Local and state governments used every possible lever to stall the spread of this disease including the difficult decisions of closing businesses and schools, using only the data available to them.  \\n\\nWhat has this last year plus taught us about using data to collectively solve problems?  \\n\\nAt the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, we became a trusted resource for millions of viewers worldwide. Over the course of weeks, JHU developed a methodology for scraping public data and encouraged state and local governments to share their data in standardized ways. JHU data scientists set up internal governance and articulated standard collection methods under the guidance of public health and medical experts. We openly shared the entire process with the public.  \\n\\nBy January 2021, we had accrued more than a billion views. Our audience included news outlets, local governments, and everyday people that were making deeply personal decisions about how they would navigate their public lives. The backdrop to our entire pandemic experience was and continues to be a hunger for sound, publicly available data.  \\n\\nThis Congress has an opportunity to capitalize on this public demand for data, the financial investments we already made in data infrastructure, and the newly minted analytic skill that has emerged across government during the COVID-19 pandemic and improve upon the systems to provide accountability, accessibility, consistency, equity, and sustainability. But there are lessons I can offer that have been helpful over the course of my public sector career.  \\n\\n> \u201cWe need data standards. We must invest in better demographics data collection. Data must be publicly available.\u201d  \\n\\nThe first instinct when you consider strengthening a data practice is to think about IT modernization or tools. But the truth is, the most important element of a strong data practice is actually in the governance and alignment of creating a common language and rules around how and why data is collected and applied to problem solving. Across the many simple definitions vary, multiple agencies with different ways of collecting addresses, enrollment numbers, the definition of recipient, race or household variables that make understanding conditions in our communities challenging. This will not be solved by one agency; this is an interagency dilemma that requires a centralized administrative focus.  \\n\\nState and federal demographic data does not align. Inconsistencies in categorization between states and even within states make data incomparable and can obfuscate the disproportionate effects that the pandemic and, in reality, across all programs targeted at entrenched social determinants of health have had on people of color. During our COVID tracking we learned that some states even lack standardization within their own health departments, using different demographic categories between testing data and vaccination data. Without standards there is no way to analyze available data to locate vulnerable populations and appropriately intervene.  \\n\\nFinally, whenever possible, make data public. While I applaud that many of these bills require data collection in a manner that is anonymized, disaggregated, and stratified by race, ethnicity, age, sex, geographic region, they do not all provide a plan for public dissemination, which is a shame as these data will be high-quality, high-resolution, and in high demand.  \\n\\nGovernment will not be able to turn the tide on the social determinants of health alone. It will require deep coordination and public engagement in the most intimate of ways. Our center at JHU continues to work to build the capacity of local leaders to use more data as they examine their own practices and architect on the ground strategies to deliver better outcomes for people but they need the support of our partners within the federal government to have the greatest impact.  \\n\\n---  \\n\\nTitle image from Jessica Rodriguez Rivas, [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0), via Wikimedia Commons.","legacyIsNew":false,"isDrafted":null,"order":0,"date":"07/06/21","attachments":["/images/assets/Congress_Stock_Image_38827611fa.jpg"],"verticals":["pandemic-data-initiative"],"authors":["beth-blauer"]},{"id":90,"slug":"making-data-driven-healthcare-decisions-with-covid-19","meta":{"path":"/pandemic-data-initiative/news/making-data-driven-healthcare-decisions-with-covid-19","title":"Making Data-Driven Healthcare Decisions with COVID-19","description":"Pandemic data has driven decision making, and we must reflect on the data and analyses performed across all types of organizations.","image":"/images/assets/PDI_mcdonald_256e9afcb3.jpg"},"section":"Expert Insight","title":"Making Data-Driven Healthcare Decisions with COVID-19","subtitle":null,"caption":"Healthcare organizations are tasked with making decisions in the face of incomplete and constantly changing data. Incorporating pandemic data into decision modeling has enabled organizations to act in the face of uncertainty and reflect on the impact of actions taken to make better decisions in the future.","content":"Individuals and organizations alike have faced the difficult task of making important decisions without the full force of granular, real-time data throughout the pandemic. Dr. Kathryn McDonald, Bloomberg Distinguished Professor of Health Systems, Quality and Safety, shares her experience with data-driven decision modeling and how to analyze the impact and usefulness of all data streams \u2015 including the results of past decisions \u2014 to shape future choices and public health preparedness.  \\n\\n### What challenges have healthcare organizations faced with obtaining trustworthy, real-time data for decision-making?  \\n\\nThis question is core to why we care about data, particularly as it informs decisions. What has been particularly challenging for organizations throughout the pandemic is having the data they need. Uncertainties have been plentiful, and they continue. This virus and the environment surrounding it are not constant. However, the structure of what needs to be known isn\'t new. Healthcare organizations have the right infectious disease expertise to face this problem and to develop questions surrounding the elements of data that they would need.  \\n\\nThe real challenge, from a decision-making perspective, is that there are both unknowns for which we can\'t get data and unknowns for which we could get data, but it hasn\u2019t been acquired or isn\u2019t accessible.  \\n\\n> \u201cOrganizations were facing the need to figure out what data they needed, and they also needed that data digested in a way that brought in the decision-making context.\u201d  \\n\\nAt the Society for Medical Decision Making, we organized an interface to receive input from decision makers around the country about questions they were facing and data they needed. It became obvious that data couldn\u2019t possibly exist for many of the questions. For example, there were unknowns related to a new virus or how people actually respond to interventions like masking. There were also uncertainties where organizations didn\u2019t have the data, but could look to us or their peers for it.  \\n\\n### If uncertainty and incomplete data is a given, how are these organizations making informed decisions?  \\n\\nIn the field of decision modeling, we have data inputs about the virus, theoretical outcomes, interventions and their effects, how individuals behave, and actions taken. All of that can be put together in various decision models to weigh the potential impacts of different actions. You can model out what the effects would be if a healthcare organization took one micro-action, like limiting hospital visitation, versus another micro-action with a range of uncertainties like how people will behave in response to it. This type of modeling allows us to make decisions without complete certainty, and we can modify the process as our data quality and quantity improves.  \\n\\n### What is the process for collecting data on decision outcomes and digesting that data?  \\n\\nAs a data scientist, everything is data. The outcome of any action or decision is a data input that can be incorporated into a modeling feedback loop. Over time, as data is collected on the effects of various interventions, the information about the effect of that intervention improves, so the relative impact of each possible intervention could be assessed better. It\'s a moving target from a data perspective, both what the mechanisms are and how those mechanisms affect behaviors. The fact that the virus itself can change is another complication to analyze, but it doesn\'t mean it\'s a lost cause.  \\n\\n> \u201cAnytime that uncertainty can be narrowed, it\'s possible to analyze the data you have to determine the information that\u2019s missing.\u201d  \\n\\n### How can decision modeling with pandemic data impact policy and organizational actions?  \\n\\nI\u2019ll give you the example of a team we had working in Mexico City. They knew the winter holidays were coming and that vacation behavior could affect viral spread. The team used population data they had available from Mexico City and were able to predict the timing and the level of potential surges of cases and the impacts on the healthcare delivery system that were going to come with the holidays. They could then communicate that timing and upcoming pressure to the system with decision makers.  \\n\\nThey needed a lot of different data streams to do their analysis, and excellent decision modeling abilities to do a good job with the data that they had. That experience increased their ability to have a working relationship with those who could supply the data. This highlights the data/decision feedback loop: you get to use the data, see how it informs decisions, identify gaps in the data, attempt to fill those gaps, perform sensitivity analysis, and repeat the process.  \\n\\n### What are we learning from this decision-making and data review process to better equip ourselves to quickly respond to the next public health crisis?  \\n\\nWe can\'t decide what policy changes are needed \u2014 we can\'t decide what actions could be taken to prevent the next pandemic from having such significant effects \u2015 without doing a very systematic, thorough review of what data we had when and where, how it was used, and what prevented those who needed it from having it. In disaster preparedness, after action analyses are common and will be necessary to review the pandemic. Decisions about policy and other forms of preparedness should hinge on what kind of data was used and how different data would improve the ability to respond.  \\n\\nWe have a treasure trove of activities to see where there were some best practices, what allowed these exceptional responses to occur, what was the data role, was it that the data existed, was it that the data was analyzed in a particular way, was it that there were people who could help interpret it nearby. We should not narrow our responses at this point. We need a lot of different types of expertise.  \\n\\n> \u201cWe can bring together all the different stakeholders in this pandemic under the common denominator of data.\u201d  \\n\\nThere is no one great resource that says here\'s all the data that exists, the data streams that were used, the pros and cons of each data set, and the analytics that were performed. I wish there was. The constant challenge in science is that we gravitate towards the data we have instead of asking if there is a data element we don\'t have, but need, and how to get it. Many individuals and organizations worked hard to get over impediments to data access, and we should look at where we managed, as a society, to bring together data streams that are owned or protected. A holistic analysis of data use and its relevance to decision-making will be critical to preparations for future public health crises, taking full advantage of this learning opportunity.","legacyIsNew":false,"isDrafted":null,"order":0,"date":"07/28/21","attachments":["/images/assets/PDI_mcdonald_256e9afcb3.jpg"],"verticals":["pandemic-data-initiative"],"authors":["joshua-e-porterfield-ph-d"]},{"id":57,"slug":"new-york-times-op-ed-pandemic-data-is-a-mess","meta":{"path":"/pandemic-data-initiative/news/new-york-times-op-ed-pandemic-data-is-a-mess","title":"New York Times Op-Ed: Pandemic Data Is a Mess","description":"Coronavirus Resource Center experts detailed lack of data uniformity and the urgent need for a fix","image":"/images/assets/57_82c13faa4c.jpg"},"section":"Vaccination Data","title":"New York Times Op-Ed: Pandemic Data Is a Mess","subtitle":"","caption":"Coronavirus Resource Center experts detailed lack of data uniformity and the urgent need for a fix","content":"Two of the Johns Hopkins University experts who have been leading the Coronavirus Resource Center sounded the alarm about the lack of standardized COVID-19 data in November 2020 in this [New York Times op-ed](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/23/opinion/coronavirus-testing.html).\\n\\nThe essay by Beth Blauer, associate vice provost for Public Sector Innovation, and Jennifer Nuzzo, senior scholar at the Center for Health Security, helped to inspire the mission for what has become the Pandemic Data Initiative.\\n\\n\u201cThe United States is more than eight months into the pandemic and people are back waiting in long lines to be tested as coronavirus infections surge again,\u201d wrote Blauer and Nuzzo. \u201cAnd yet there is still no federal standard to ensure testing results are being uniformly reported.

He says the public should not be pessimistic about the U.S. response to COVID-19 given the incredible advances with vaccine development and an unprecedented level of global data collection.  \\n\\n### How can supply chains adapt to reach unvaccinated populations in the United States, and what is the role of data in those efforts?  \\n\\nSupply chain management is about matching supply with demand. When demand for vaccination exceeded supply a few months ago, the focus was on generating the most vaccinations from a limited supply of vaccines. Now there is a surplus of vaccines, which comes with a problem every business faces \u2014 sustaining and increasing demand, also known as marketing. It\u2019s probably fair to say no business disciplines are more data-driven than marketing. To start with, we can use data to understand what works and what doesn\'t to reduce friction in the vaccination process.  \\n\\nData really plays a central role in evaluating effectiveness of different vaccine outreach programs, such as lotteries, as well as ensuring transparency and promoting trust. Oftentimes, people are hesitant not because of their inherent anti-vaccine beliefs, but because of stories they read on social media that don\u2019t come with context. Credible sources are rarely available at a single click, leaving people confused and helpless. I also found certain people fear they risk being labeled as anti-vaccine by sharing a link or raising a question. We need to make sure that credible  vaccine data and expert resources are as accessible as the vaccines themselves to help more people make the crucial decision to get vaccinated.  \\n\\n> \u201cWe talk about supply of vaccines, but we also must ensure that pertinent data is abundantly supplied to everyone.\u201d  \\n\\n### What data is useful for identifying supply chain weaknesses, particularly with testing kits and vaccines?  \\n\\nThe supply chain consists of flow and stock. Flow concerns how fast things are being consumed where they are, and stock is how much inventory exists at a particular moment. We need to pay as much attention to flow data as we do to stock data. People tend to worry about supply chains when they see empty shelves (i.e. insufficient stock), and by then it is too late to fix supply chain issues. Reliable and timely forecasts of vaccine flow are essential to provide a smooth vaccination effort. We should pay attention not only to inventory level, but also to trends and how supply evolves over time.  \\n\\nIn the United States we were not only tracking the number of doses distributed from the CDC, but also how many doses were actually given to people. That complete flow data is what made us more successful in vaccine distribution than with testing kits and personal protective equipment (PPE). We knew we had a lot of test kits and PPE getting distributed, but we had no idea where they were and how many units were being used.  \\n\\n### What data can we be collecting and analyzing right now to support global COVID-19 vaccination efforts?  \\n\\nOur primary target should be performance data because people are inevitably driven by performance metrics. The reason Israel was so successful with vaccinations was their motivation to become number one, and they were for quite a while. We should continue to collect, analyze, and rank vaccine supply, distribution, and administration performance across jurisdictions to inform and motivate governments to continue and expand vaccination efforts.  \\n\\nWe also must use data to highlight the correlation between vaccination progress and infection control. To sustain and even boost interest in vaccination, we need to demonstrate to the public that the vaccines work. We should be able to do that in a granular way involving demographic data so that people really see the vaccine does work and will work for people just like them.  \\n\\n### Can data inform global vaccine distribution strategies when not every country provides data publicly and in the same form?  \\n\\nThe beauty of vaccination data is that it is cleaner and more objective compared to testing and other pandemic-related data because it is binary \u2014 you either get vaccinated or you don\u2019t. There will be different brands, doses, and timing, but those are minor differences. Compare that with testing. Different countries, regions, and providers have very different diagnostic standards and reporting criteria. In that sense, vaccination data can be a powerful way to inform us about global vaccine distribution strategies and help different countries learn from each other because it is so easily comparable. For example, people are surprised to learn Canada is ahead of the United States, United Kingdom, and Israel in first-dose vaccinations, and we should use that surprise to motivate us to learn from their success and inform our own vaccination efforts.  \\n\\n> \u201cThe beauty of data is that it can reveal trends and help us learn from each other quickly.\u201d  \\n\\n### How could artificial intelligence (AI) in data analysis improve future pandemic responses and what data is needed to develop those systems?  \\n\\nI do believe AI can help identify and reduce disparities and improve efficiency in healthcare, but only if we have the right kind of data and performance metrics. The possibilities are limitless. We could have AI-based demand forecasting to minimize waste and shortages of healthcare materials. We can also use AI to identify and prioritize critical populations to maximize effectiveness of limited vaccines. AI could help correlate vaccine progress and infection control.  \\n\\nAI is utilized for similar activities in the private sector. We already have most of the data and technology we need to transition AI efforts to healthcare. We have high-quality demographics data, mobility data (travel, distance, frequency), and health data about infection and mortality, but we need to establish connections between different databases so that they can talk to each other.  \\n\\n> \u201cThe challenge is not having more data, but connecting our existing, disparate data sources.\u201d  \\n\\n### How will the next pandemic be different because of existing data?  \\n\\nIf you rank the vaccination rates of the states for this pandemic and compare the result with the next most recent pandemic, H1N1, the top and bottom states are basically the same. It just shows that this pandemic is not as unique as we think it is, and we have a lot to learn from history and from each other. Hopefully we are reaching the end of this pandemic, but we should make sure that we are actually learning and preparing for future public health crises. We have never before had the quantity and quality data like what we have today, and we can leverage it to radically change the trajectory of the next pandemic before it even starts.\\n","legacyIsNew":false,"isDrafted":null,"order":0,"date":"07/07/21","attachments":["/images/assets/PDI_TD_7_7_07ab7d6e84.jpg"],"verticals":["pandemic-data-initiative"],"authors":["joshua-e-porterfield-ph-d"]},{"id":72,"slug":"q-and-a-data-may-be-universal-but-context-and-format-are-not","meta":{"path":"/pandemic-data-initiative/news/q-and-a-data-may-be-universal-but-context-and-format-are-not","title":"Q&A: Data May Be Universal, but Context and Format Are Not","description":"Sara Bertran de Lis of the Coronavirus Resource Center discusses how data collection efforts have changed over the pandemic and what needs to be done next","image":"/images/assets/PDI_SB_6_16_2d6b89feb1.jpg"},"section":"Expert Insight","title":"Q&A: Data May Be Universal, but Context and Format Are Not","subtitle":null,"caption":"Dr. Sara Bertran de Lis explains the evolution of COVID-19 data collection efforts, applauding states for their work while recommending changes needed to improve policy making and public communication.","content":"Dr. Sara Bertran De Lis is the head data scientist at the Coronavirus Resource Center. She has previously led efforts at the Centers for Civic Impact to help local governments better understand, collect, and utilize data. She now brings her expertise to U.S. and international COVID-19 data management efforts.  \\n\\n### How have the CRC\u2019s data collection efforts evolved during the pandemic?  \\n\\nOur data collection has evolved with each subsequent effort. While the process itself has been consistent, we have learned to predict how things are most likely going to change in the dashboards and try to accommodate these changes in the data structure in advance. This has made our data collection flexible, but robust enough that we don\u2019t have to redo everything each time a state performs an update.  \\n\\nWe are now focusing on collecting and analyzing demographic data across states. Without standardization of demographic definitions and granularity in this data, you cannot identify and locate vulnerable populations. There are so many variables when crafting hypotheses about demographics that unless you have very detailed non-aggregated, local data, you\'re never going to be able to answer any questions. High-level aggregated numbers will identify disparities, but they prevent us from further analyzing them to determine the causes, extent, and potential solutions.  \\n\\n> \u201cLack of standardization within a single state is unacceptable, and needs to be addressed before we can discuss national standards.\u201d  \\n\\n### What can states change to improve data collection and reporting?  \\n\\nFirst of all, data should be scrapable or machine-readable, which means that we can develop code to search for the updated data on the internet, read it, and record it, removing the need for individuals to search through state websites one by one. Downloadable data tables, numbers embedded in the web page, or anything in a dashboard where we can access the source code are great. Even structured PDFs that use the same format on every iteration are useful to the absolutely brilliant data team at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. However, some states use press releases, images, or graphics, which are not useful formats and really hinder data collection and analysis because they cannot be automatically scraped by the APL software and the data they contain is often incomplete or in aggregated form, lacking all critical detail.  \\n\\nStandardization is also a major issue, but the tricky question is, \u201cwho is responsible for it?\u201d The states obviously can play a role by using standards when they exist, but sometimes there are several different standards or none at all. More concerningly than differences in standardization between states is that sometimes divisions within the same state health departments have different standards. We have observed some states that employ different demographic categories for vaccination data than for cases and deaths, such as [Georgia](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/pandemic-data-initiative/news/demographic-data-disarray-hurts-covid-19-policies).  \\n\\n> \u201cStates have never before had to collect this much data, analyze it, and release it in real-time. They have done an incredible job.\u201d  \\n\\n### Why should states keep collecting and reporting public health data?  \\n\\nWhile it is easy to criticize, the truth is that every time a state publishes a piece of data there is an enormous amount of effort that goes into it. They have to develop a system to collect individual raw data points, validate the data, clean it up, perform quality checks, validate some more, and then actually publish the information.  \\n\\nIt would be a pity to abandon these data systems now. Local governments are constantly making decisions, implementing actions, and improving policies that can be so much better informed by near real-time, high quality data. Public data also empowers individual people to make informed decisions about their personal lives. Individual interaction with the data has resulted in improved data quality and some incredible inventions throughout the pandemic. States should foster that level of public trust and engagement in the future.  \\n\\n### What have you learned about how individual Americans consume public health data?  \\n\\nWe sometimes doubt the public\u2019s interest in data, but the pandemic has shown us that people are interested in data and they are demanding more. I have learned not to underestimate the ability of people to read and interpret a visualization, notice a mistake, contact you, and therefore improve the overall data quality. I also think my ability to create data visualizations that are understandable for the public has increased dramatically.  \\n\\nThe process of deciding what questions a visualization will answer is very important. Once that is decided, we start sketching mock-ups and doing rounds of reviews. After many, many rounds of review among people with diverse backgrounds, we will agree on a final design. I would say that at least 30 people have given feedback incorporated into each visualization on the CRC site.  \\n\\n> \u201cNumbers are a universal language, but they need context and that\'s not universally accessible and understood.\u201d  \\n\\n### What do you see as the role of the CRC as we enter a later stage of the pandemic characterized by fewer cases and plateauing vaccinations?  \\n\\nThe pandemic is not over even though we in the United States have a higher number of vaccinations compared to other countries. We never know if a new vaccine-resistant variant of the virus is going to appear anywhere in the world; then it won\'t matter how fast a country has been vaccinated. Monitoring internationally is going to have a much more important role now.  \\n\\nLuckily, we are less demanding with international data. For example, we are probably only going to be interested in the percentage of the population that is fully vaccinated, not which type of vaccine and where it was administered. These essential data are more common between countries compared to what we have been trying to get from states, but there are other challenges. The health systems in other countries are totally different with many languages, reporting methods, and web pages to navigate.","legacyIsNew":false,"isDrafted":null,"order":0,"date":"06/16/21","attachments":["/images/assets/PDI_SB_6_16_2d6b89feb1.jpg"],"verticals":["pandemic-data-initiative"],"authors":["joshua-e-porterfield-ph-d"]},{"id":91,"slug":"differences-in-positivity-rates-review","meta":{"path":"/testing/differences-in-positivity-rates-review","title":"Changes to Test Positivity Tracking Efforts","description":"Learn more about why the positivity rates shown on our site may differ from state calculations.","image":""},"section":"","title":"Differences in Positivity Rates [Review]","subtitle":null,"caption":"Learn more about why the positivity rates shown on our site may differ from state calculations.","content":"Since we launched the COVID-19 Testing Insights Initiative on the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center (CRC), both the testing landscape and the data environment in the United States have changed considerably. This page explains how those changes result in differences between our site\u2019s calculations and some state estimates.\\n\\nIt is important to note that test positivity is a measure of testing capacity and while it can provide important context about case totals and trends, it is NOT a measure of how prevalent the virus is in communities. **Policy decisions, like openings and closings or interstate travel, should not be determined based on test positivity alone.**\\n\\n#### The State of U.S. Testing\\n\\n**In the U.S., there are no federal standards for reporting COVID-19 testing data.** This makes it impossible to offer a fully apples-to-apples view of testing data at the national level. Without federal standards, states have been left to forge their own paths, and as a result, they report testing data differently.  \\n\\n- Under the current conditions, inputs into the same data categories differ between states. For example, in one state, the data for the number of tests administered might include both antigen tests and PCR tests. In another state, the testing data might only include PCR tests. This means that while the data category (\u201cnumber of tests\u201d) is the same, the inputs and resulting calculation are different.  \\n \\n- Since the beginning of the pandemic, states have changed the amount and the type of testing data they report, and have been inconsistent in how they report antigen tests.  \\n\\n- Some states also periodically pause or fully stop sharing key data that are used in making positivity calculations, or change the cadence with which they report data. Both of these actions can create abnormal spikes in positivity rates in tracking efforts such as ours.  \\n\\nThese inconsistencies may result in a test positivity calculation on our site that is different from what states report.\\n\\n- We routinely review our data inputs and approach to ensure that our numbers reflect the most responsible public health calculation of test positivity.\\u2028\\n\\n\\n#### Different Approaches to Positivity Calculations\\n\\n[According to the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/resources/calculating-percent-positivity.html), and based on the testing data that states currently share, there are several possible ways to calculate test positivity. A state\u2019s positivity rate will be different depending on which approach is used. **Per the CDC, each of these approaches are valid, but they provide different insights into the impact and limitations of a state\u2019s testing efforts.**  \\n\\nWe believe it is important to look at both people-centered calculations and test-focused calculations, as each provides different information about a state\u2019s testing efforts. We have identified 4 possible ways to calculate positivity. Below, you can view the variation in states\u2019 positivity rates based on each of the approaches, and the wide discrepancies in the availability of data needed to make each of these calculations:\\n\\n- **Approach 1: Viral Positive Specimens / Viral Total Specimens.** The number of positive molecular (PCR)\xa0tests\xa0divided by the total number of molecular\xa0tests.\\n\\n![__embed](specimen_specimen)\\n\\n- **Approach 2: Viral Positive Specimens / Viral Total Encounters.** The number of positive molecular (PCR)\xa0tests\xa0divided by the total number of molecular\xa0tests given within a specified timeframe.\\n\\n![__embed](specimen_encounter)\\n\\n- **Approach 3: Viral Positive People / Viral Total People.** The number of\xa0people\xa0who test positive with molecular (PCR) tests divided by the total number of\xa0people\xa0tested with molecular tests.\\n\\n![__embed](people_people)\\n\\n- **Approach 4: Viral Positive People / Viral Total Encounters.** The number of\xa0people\xa0who test positive with molecular (PCR) tests divided by total number of molecular (PCR)\xa0tests given within a specified timeframe.  \\n\\n![__embed](confirmed_encounter)\\n\\n- **Approach 5: Viral Positive People / Viral Total Specimens.** The number of\xa0people\xa0who test positive with molecular (PCR) tests divided by total number of molecular (PCR)\xa0tests.  \\n\\n![__embed](confirmed_specimen)\\n\\n- **Hierarchy** \\n\\n![__embed](hierarchy)\\n\\n#### CRC Approach to Positivity Calculations\\n\\n**The Coronavirus Resource Center\u2019s current approach to calculating positivity throughout our site is Approach 4, for the following reasons:**  \\n\\n1. The lack of federal standards creates significant inconsistencies in how states report testing data. Currently, Approach 4 is the only one that can be used for all 50 states.\\n\\n2. Our data scientists and epidemiologists believe a people-centered calculation allows users to gauge whether states are casting a wide enough net with their testing to identify infections that may be occurring.  \\n\\n3. By looking at the percentage of people who test positive, we also can see whether there are testing participation, access, or capacity problems that need to be addressed.\\n \\nIt is worth noting that historically, Approach 4 focused more on the number of people tested as opposed to the number of tests given, and is the only people-centered calculation for which all states report the necessary data. We routinely monitor the data environment and make changes if necessary.\\n\\n#### Repeat Testing\\n\\nDepending on how states report data on the number of people tested (e.g., whether they deduplicate data for each person tested), calculating positivity using Approach 4 may not capture repeat tests performed on the same person.  \\n\\n**The CRC believes that as the pandemic has progressed and testing capacity has expanded, there are important public health reasons to conduct multiple tests on the same person.**\\n\\n- For example, someone who was exposed early in the pandemic may have a subsequent exposure and need to be retested.  \\n\\n- Additionally, states are increasingly conducting routine, repeat screening tests in high-risk populations, such as those in nursing homes.  \\n\\n**At the same time, including these repeat tests may obscure important trends and early warning signals.** For example, there is an increasing amount of screening testing being conducted within states for certain populations \u2013 such as colleges, universities, and large employers.This means that at one point in Washington D.C., tests performed by a major university represented approximately 20 percent of all tests conducted, which could skew the data for the District broadly.\\n\\n#### Conclusion\\n\\n**Despite the limitations outlined above, we believe it is important to continue to calculate and track each state\u2019s test positivity using Approach 4, which is a people-centered calculation, where possible.** We continue to make every effort to use the best data available and will continue to monitor the data environment and make changes as necessary.  \\n\\nTo explore this issue further, read [Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo\'s interview with The Baltimore Sun](https://www.baltimoresun.com/coronavirus/bs-md-hopkins-new-positivity-rate-20201023-jcmev6pxrfdulfmxk2iyhcw6ym-story.html).\\n\\n#### Data Sources: This initiative relies upon publicly available data from multiple sources.\\n\\n**States are not consistent in how and when they release and update their data, and some may even retroactively change the numbers they report. This can affect the percentages you see presented in these data visualizations. We are taking steps to account for these irregularities in how we present the information, but it is important to understand the full context behind these data.**","legacyIsNew":false,"isDrafted":true,"order":0,"date":"","attachments":[],"verticals":[],"authors":[]},{"id":53,"slug":"cities-can-use-data-to-improve-vaccine-outreach","meta":{"path":"/pandemic-data-initiative/news/cities-can-use-data-to-improve-vaccine-outreach","title":"Cities Can Use Data To Improve Vaccine Outreach","description":"Local government can improve vaccination rates in minority communities where distrust in the medical establishment runs deep","image":"/images/assets/53_dfcb4e2af5.jpg"},"section":"Demographic Data","title":"Cities Can Use Data To Improve Vaccine Outreach","subtitle":"","caption":"Local government can improve vaccination rates in minority communities where distrust in the medical establishment runs deep","content":"Reliable, detailed demographic data can help city leaders find neighborhood gaps in vaccinations, deploy resources to address them, and permanently keep those medical assets in minority communities where an absence of healthcare facilities is a primary reason COVID-19 struck them so hard. \\n\\nHere are steps cities can take when equipped with consistent data, according to Beth Blauer, Associate Vice Provost for Public Sector Innovation: \\n\\n1.

Here at the PDI we have focused largely on the high level measures that are guiding policy makers through their decision-making process. But what does that feel like at the bedside, on the COVID units and in our ICUs? How are medical professionals using data to support their decision making as they also navigate the unknowns of a new virus? One example of this comes from [Johns Hopkins inHealth](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/inhealth/), the precision medicine arm of Johns Hopkins, which seeks to leverage what has been learned from the COVID-19 pandemic to improve discovery and clinical outcomes.  \\n\\ninHealth\u2019s [Precision Medicine Analytics Platform (PMAP)](https://pm.jh.edu/) and the [JH-CROWN registry](https://ictr.johnshopkins.edu/coronavirus/jh-crown/) -- which includes anonymized data such as demographic characteristics, medical history, and laboratory results from COVID-19 patients at all five hospitals in the Hopkins system -- have enabled teams to develop new tools for patients and healthcare providers.  \\n\\nOne data-driven invention to come out of this framework was the COVID-19 Inpatient Risk Calculator (CIRC) <sup>1</sup>, which quantifies the probability of progression to severe disease or death among patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Researchers designed algorithms and statistical models to analyze and discover patterns in COVID-19 patient data. This machine learning process measured the historical effects of readily accessible patient data (demographics, vital signs, lab results, etc.) on their COVID-19 outcomes. The results were then assembled in a calculator that could compute the probability of a given patient progressing to severe disease once that individual\u2019s data were inputted. Armed with support from the tool, medical teams could then help make critical decisions about where and how to treat patients.  \\n\\nThe development of CIRC was driven by a desire to understand the risk factors that predict hospitalization and the likelihood of a patient progressing to severe disease or death. The team found that if a patient came from a nursing home, had other underlying conditions/illnesses, was older, had a higher BMI, etc., it was more likely that they would experience an undesirable outcome. However, CIRC\u2019s power as a prediction tool was limited because it only used data from a patient\u2019s admission to the hospital and could not update over time.  \\n\\nCIRC laid the groundwork for the subsequent development of the Severe COVID-19 Adaptive Risk Predictor (SCARP) <sup>2</sup>, which does allow for real-time updates to predictions as new patient data are acquired. SCARP bins vital signs and labs into discrete chunks of time, accounts for all the bins and their changes, and then provides an updated prediction of COVID-19 prognosis. It can be used in real time by clinicians within the first 14 days of a hospital stay to identify patients with a very high likelihood of requiring imminent ICU-level care and plan interventions to alter that trajectory.  \\n\\n![SCARP-Workflow-Diagram]()\\n\\nA version of SCARP has been available in the Johns Hopkins Electronic Health Record (EHR) since late January 2021. There is also a [free version available online](https://rsconnect.biostat.jhsph.edu/covid_trajectory/) for providers to use the tool at hospitals outside of the Johns Hopkins network.  \\n\\nBecause Johns Hopkins uses a universal data language, it can be transparent about the methods used to create models and to validate them with its proprietary data, then share the code. While privacy is always an issue with patient data, this system allows Johns Hopkins to make tools available for use at other hospitals without sharing specific patient data.  \\n\\nNone of this data would exist without the sacrifices of frontline healthcare providers, patients, and their families. And, Hopkins researchers plan to continue working with these data to determine how the lessons learned from CIRC and SCARP might apply to diseases other than COVID-19.  Researchers are adapting the risk evaluation methods established by CIRC and SCARP to similar respiratory diseases, such as influenza and pneumonia. The ultimate goal is for medical providers to walk into a patient\u2019s room armed with data about everything that has happened to the patient up to that moment, gather additional information, and then use all available data to make the next decision. That is the promise of true precision medicine, and a bounty of skills that decision makers across the board should understand and begin to hone.  \\n\\n***Title image courtesy of Dr. Shannon Wongvibulsin***   \\n\\n---  \\n\\nReferences  \\n\\n1.

The data from all jurisdictions is critical to continuing effective pandemic responses.","content":"Around the globe, there is still a deadly pandemic.  Many countries are confronting a new wave of cases driven by the Delta variant. Russia has been breaking daily death records<sup>1</sup> and the daily case rate in the United Kingdom is surpassing 2020 levels while continuing to accelerate<sup>2</sup>. The Gamma variant continues to ravage South America, but now Lambda may take over as vaccination rates remain low across the continent<sup>3</sup>.  \\n\\nI have said this before and am reiterating here, to avoid a similar devastating resurgence in the United States, governments of all sizes -- local, state, and federal -- need to continue their data collection efforts. Unfortunately the trends of data shops closing up and slowing reporting persist.  Many states are limiting or stopping public reporting of vital data, a move that will limit the nation\u2019s ability to anticipate disease spread.  \\n\\nIt has been over six months since the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines in the United States, which was an incredible feat of science, logistics, and leadership. However, vaccination coverage across the U.S. is stagnating [just below 50%](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/vaccines/us-states), much less coverage than the ~70% vaccination rate in the U.K., which is experiencing some of the worst effects of COVID-19 in months<sup>2</sup>. The data collection and surveillance efforts established across all levels of government in the United States are now even more valuable as we watch for breakthrough cases and the emergence of the Delta variant.  \\n\\nAt the beginning of this pandemic we learned that the United States lacked data infrastructure to adequately respond to a new public health crisis. I commend the efforts of governments on all levels to fund, develop, and grow their public health data collection systems in response to COVID-19, and now is not the time to slow down. Data is critical at all geographic levels: county, state, and federal. While the PDI has addressed the importance of [maintaining temporal data resolution through reporting cadences](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/pandemic-data-initiative/news/we-need-a-daily-data-dump), we now need to discuss the importance of geographic resolution.  \\n\\n### County Data  \\n\\n![County-Cases-0708.jpg]()\\n\\nThe above image is a screenshot of the CRC\u2019s [U.S. Map for new cases](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/us-map) from July 8, 2021. The blank spaces would appear to indicate that some states had zero new cases of COVID-19. However, here \u201czero\u201d doesn\u2019t mean zero cases; it means zero data as some states, such as Alabama<sup>4,5</sup>, Alaska<sup>6</sup>, Florida<sup>5,7</sup>, Oklahoma<sup>8</sup>, and South Dakota<sup>9</sup> have stopped reporting county-level case data daily.  \\n\\nCounty-level data enables local public health officials to catch breakthrough cases of COVID-19 in areas with high vaccination rates and notice hotspots in low vaccination areas that would otherwise be impossible to pinpoint from averaged state-wide data. It also gives individuals and families the information they need to make important decisions on traveling, school, or just going to the grocery store. County-level data can also highlight the positive impacts of mitigation techniques, such as masking, and empower local officials to reintroduce additional measures if COVID-19 is resurging.  \\n\\nWe are already seeing instances of individual counties having a dramatic rise in per capita cases and deaths from COVID-19 unmatched by the rest of the state. *As of July 3, 2021*: Colorado has high vaccination coverage, beating the U.S. average at 53%; however, Moffat County, Colorado is experiencing 54 new cases a day per 100,000 people<sup>10</sup> - almost 20 times the *state average*. The issue of \u201chotspot\u201d counties is further amplified in states like Arkansas with low vaccination rates, where 13% of counties are displaying 20 or more new cases daily per capita, much higher than other counties in the state, with Dallas County alone experiencing 94 new cases a day per 100,000 people<sup>10</sup>. Without county-level data, COVID-19 variants can fester unnoticed until they spread across the rest of the state and country. We would have no way of flagging those surges if it wasn\u2019t for county-level data collection efforts.  \\n\\n### State Data  \\n\\nState dashboards have been one of the most incredible products of the COVID-19 pandemic response, and I have made it clear that I believe they should be a tool that we continue to fund and utilize in perpetuity. Not everyone agrees. Many states have reduced their reporting cadences, and some, like Nebraska, are completely shutting down their dashboards and directing their citizens to CDC for data<sup>11</sup>. This is not acceptable.  \\n\\n[As discussed by Dr. Tinglong Dai](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/pandemic-data-initiative/news/q-and-a-linking-supply-chain-and-public-health-data), having state-level data equips us to better learn from each other and improve our responses to this pandemic and future crises. Without state-level data there is no way to assess policies, gauge success, and make informed changes to state response. In the case of a new variant outbreak, state-level data will be critical to understand the efficacy of vaccines, policies, and mitigation strategies, so it is short-sighted to shut down state reporting efforts now.  \\n\\n### Federal Data  \\n\\nThe CDC has done what once felt impossible during this pandemic, wrangling data from thousands of disparate sources and trying to shape blanket policies and guidelines that equally cover and assist a diverse nation of people. One of the difficulties CDC faces as the federal government\u2019s official public health record keeper is that it is limited to sharing data received from written, standardized reports from the states. Throughout the pandemic this has resulted in major lags and significant discrepancies between CDC\u2019s data website and state data dashboards.  \\n\\n[Last week](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/pandemic-data-initiative/news/sharing-lessons-from-pandemic-data-management-with-congress) I shared my experience testifying before Congress regarding upcoming bills to establish rules for state data reporting for both COVID-19 and social determinants of health. It is important to have a robust data stream at the federal level, as it will have the most impact on shaping policy and allocating future resources. Additionally, the federal government is tasked with preparing our country for the next public health crisis, and that effort is unlikely to be fruitful without robust, detailed data. As part of its federal mandate, the CDC will continue to keep records on COVID-19, but whether the states are required to share data with any level of detail with the CDC is yet to be determined.  \\n\\n### All Data Are Important for Our Future  \\n\\nWe set up this public health data infrastructure over the past year not because it was easy, but because it was essential. We have learned that a decades-long divestment in public health has led to a catastrophic inability to navigate fast moving and deadly pandemic. If anything, we need to reimagine public investment in health and double down on better reporting and public health infrastructure, not return to business as usual. Nothing has changed the importance of public health data, and the investments we have made both financially and with human effort deserve to be honored and continued. We have collected an unprecedented amount of public health data because of this pandemic and we can leverage it to significantly improve the country\u2019s health and safety. The data can also begin to help us address social determinants of health, systemic racism, and healthcare inequality. None of that will be possible without robust, updated data streams on the local, state, and federal levels.  \\n\\n---  \\n\\nReferences  \\n1.

People have to understand that while breakthrough infections are rare, they are also to be expected with any vaccine.  \\n\\nVaccines rarely, if ever, have what we call \u201csterilizing immunity\u201d where they completely prevent infection.  \\n\\nVaccines act differently than masks, which serve as barriers that can actually prevent the virus from getting into our bodies to infect our cells.  \\n\\nVaccines don\u2019t do that. The virus can still enter our bodies and infect our cells after we are vaccinated. The power of vaccines come after that point. That\u2019s when our immune systems \u2013 which have been primed by the vaccines \u2013 kick in to fight off the infection. Sometimes the immune system can rapidly clear the infection before there is much viral replication. But other times there is some viral replication.  \\n\\n> \u201cThe current vaccines provide very high protection against the Delta variant.\u201d  \\n\\nSome people will have mild symptoms while many remain asymptomatic. The vast majority, however, will avoid suffering from severe disease that leads to hospitalization and possible death. Our vaccines are protective against severe disease.  \\n\\n*For more on breakthrough infections, see [Breakthrough Infections Are Rare But Expected](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/vaccines/q-n-a/breakthrough-infections-are-rare-but-expected)*  \\n\\n### Are the current vaccines effective against the Delta variant?  \\n\\nYes. Very effective, in fact. Two shots of the Pfizer vaccine are 88% effective against the Delta variant in preventing symptomatic disease. That compares with 94% effectiveness against the Alpha variant. It\u2019s a little lower, but it is still very high protectiveness for any vaccine. It\u2019s far higher than the effective rates of the vaccines developed against seasonal flu.  \\n\\nWe would need to worry if the effectiveness were something like 30%. That\u2019s when we would definitely need booster shots or even a new vaccine specifically targeting the Delta variant. But we\u2019re not in that situation. The current vaccines provide very high protection against the Delta variant.  \\n\\n*For more on boosters, see [Will Vaccinated People Need Boosters?](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/vaccines/q-n-a/will-vaccinated-people-need-booster-doses)*\\n\\n### When will the United States achieve herd immunity?  \\n\\nI\u2019m often hesitant to raise the issue of herd immunity because it\u2019s a much more nuanced concept than we generally talk about. It\u2019s related to the basic reproductive number of the virus, which is on average how many other individuals are infected from a single case. With the original variant of SARS-CoV-2, the reproductive number was about 2.5 \u2013 so each single case would infect 2.5 other people. To take the simplest formula, the herd immunity threshold for such a reproductive number would be about 60%. That\u2019s the number we were talking about at the beginning of the pandemic.  \\n\\n> \u201cBreakthrough infections are rare, they are also expected with any vaccine.\u201d\\n\\nBut the Delta variant has doubled that reproductive number to about 5 or 6. That gets the herd immunity threshold up to 80 or 85%. We\u2019re nowhere near that in the United States. Just 50% of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated.  \\n\\nNow if all adults had achieved the vaccination coverage that adults over age 65 have achieved \u2013 which is 80% -- we would be far closer to that magical herd immunity threshold. The only way to get close to that is for the United States to get back to vaccinating the amount of people every day that it was at the start of the rollout \u2013 about 3 million. Today we\u2019re vaccinating on average just 300,000 people a day.  \\n\\nAnyone who doubts the vaccines should remember where we were at the start of the vaccination rollout in January: about 250,000 new cases and 3,500 deaths every day. That was before the Delta variant. It\u2019s hard to imagine that right now thanks to the level of vaccination coverage we\u2019ve achieved. But the new cases and hospitalizations are being driven primarily among the unvaccinated parts of the nation.  \\n\\n*For more on herd immunity, see [No Magic Number for Herd Immunity](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/vaccines/q-n-a/no-magic-number-for-herd-immunity).*  \\n\\n### Why did the CDC change its masking recommendations for fully vaccinated people?  \\n\\nThe Delta variant was not as dominant when the CDC lifted its masking recommendations for fully vaccinated people.  \\n\\nNow that the Delta variant is the predominant version of the virus \u2013 and, most importantly, the fact that case numbers, hospitalizations, and deaths are increasing \u2013 the CDC changed those recommendations knowing, as we discussed above, that fully vaccinated individuals can carry and transmit the virus.  \\n\\n### What more can the government do to encourage people to get vaccinated?  \\n\\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not given any vaccine full approval. Currently they are all being administered under an EUA, or emergency use authorization. Many people still consider the vaccines to be experimental because they\u2019re under that EUA.  \\n\\nA full FDA approval might sway some people to accept vaccinations. But that full approval would have the biggest impact on providing the support employers, school systems, and others will need to require vaccinations.  \\n\\n> \u201cNew cases and hospitalizations are being driven primarily in the nation\u2019s unvaccinated regions.\u201d  \\n\\nDo I think the vaccines need full FDA approval to prove that they\u2019re safe and effective? No. An EUA does not mean the vaccines are less safe. The same safety protocols were followed as with all other vaccine trials. The fact that we were able to test them on so many people so quickly, in large part because they were tested during a pandemic when case numbers were high \u2013 allowing us to quickly see the differences in case numbers between those who received the vaccine and those who received the placebo, provided enough evidence that they are safe and efficacious.  \\n\\nMore than 1 billion people around the world have been vaccinated and 164 million people have been vaccinated in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been tracking adverse events through its [V-safe program](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafe.html) and the FDA\u2019s tracking system is the [Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System](https://vaers.hhs.gov/).  \\n\\nThe United States initiated a pause in the Johnson & Johnson vaccine after identifying a rare blood clotting disorder in just six people who had received the vaccine. The system is working like it would with any vaccine.  \\n\\n*For more on vaccine development, see [Vaccine Research & Development](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/vaccines/timeline)*  \\n*For more on vaccine hesitancy, see [People Hesitant to Receive Vaccines Need Empathy](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/vaccines/q-n-a/people-hesitant-to-receive-vaccines-need-empathy-from-medical-providers)*  ","legacyIsNew":true,"isDrafted":null,"order":0,"date":"07/30/21","attachments":[],"verticals":[],"authors":["william-moss"]},{"id":63,"slug":"breakthrough-infections-are-rare-but-expected","meta":{"path":"/vaccines/q-n-a/breakthrough-infections-are-rare-but-expected","title":"Q&A: Breakthrough Infections Are Rare But Expected","description":"Recent news that nine vaccinated baseball players for the New York Yankees tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has thrust the concept of \u201cbreakthrough infections\u201d to the forefront of public discourse about U.S. vaccination efforts.","image":""},"section":"Vaccines Q & A","title":"Q&A: Breakthrough Infections Are Rare But Expected","subtitle":null,"caption":"Recent news that nine vaccinated baseball players for the New York Yankees tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has thrust the concept of \u201cbreakthrough infections\u201d to the forefront of public discourse about U.S. vaccination efforts. William Moss, vaccinology lead for the Coronavirus Resource Center and executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center, discusses the rare but expected presence of breakthrough infections. ","content":"### What is a breakthrough infection?  \\n\\nA breakthrough infection is anyone who is considered fully immunized \u2013 two weeks after a final vaccination shot \u2013 but who subsequently becomes infected with SARS-CoV-2.  \\n\\n### Are breakthrough infections expected with vaccines?  \\n\\nThe problem in terms of public perception is that people think breakthrough infections mean that vaccines don\u2019t work. That\u2019s certainly not the case. Breakthrough infections are expected because no vaccine is perfect.  \\n\\n### How many breakthrough case investigations have there been?  \\n\\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Breakthrough Case Investigations and Reporting had been tracking incidents through April 26, 2021, when more than 95 million people had been fully vaccinated in the United States. At that time there were 9,245 reported incidents of breakthrough infections from 46 states, according to the CDC.  \\n\\n> \u2018Breakthrough infections are expected because no vaccine is perfect.\u2019  \\n\\nThat is a very, very low rate of 0.01%. There is some undercounting since breakthrough infections can only be counted by states if the infections are detected, and many were asymptomatic like with the New York Yankees players.  \\n\\nThe CDC has now switched to tracking only breakthrough infections that have led to serious illness and hospitalizations and deaths. That will generate higher quality data on breakthrough cases.  \\n\\n### When would the country need to worry about breakthrough infections?  \\n\\nThe red flag indicating that we might have a problem with the current vaccines would be if we start seeing breakthrough infections associated with a special viral variant that was causing hospitalizations and deaths. That would be a trigger for serious concern \u2013 and the need for booster doses or modified vaccines.  \\n\\n### What are the reasons for breakthrough infections?  \\n\\nIt can  be very difficult to determine why they occur in an individual person but there are three categories to consider.  \\n\\nFirst, is it something about the person who got vaccinated? We would expect to see more breakthrough infections in people whose immune systems are compromised by cancer or HIV or immunosuppressive drugs used to treat some conditions.  \\n\\n> \u2018It could be something about the person, the vaccine, or the virus.\u2019  \\n\\nSecond, is it something about the vaccine? Different vaccines have different protective efficacies. We\u2019ve seen the highest protective efficacy with the mRNA vaccines and somewhat lower with the adenovirus-vectored vaccines and even lower with inactivated virus vaccines not authorized for use in the U.S. So there are vaccine characteristics that could make it more likely that a breakthrough infection could occur.  \\n\\nIn addition, the CDC would want to know whether a cluster of breakthroughs involved vaccines from the same lot to make sure there wasn\u2019t something that happened in the manufacturing pipeline that may have reduced the protective efficacy of that vaccine. We haven\u2019t seen that yet, but that\u2019s something to look out for.  \\n\\nThird, is there something about the virus itself. Of most concern would be whether there are viral variants that may be causing breakthrough infections. For example, the AstraZeneca vaccine seems to provide reduced protection against the B.1.351 variant first identified in South Africa, which opted to no longer use the vaccine.  \\n\\nThe most important public health concern is whether there will be variants that emerge that are more likely to cause breakthrough infections, especially if they cause hospitalizations and deaths. That\u2019s the real concern.  \\n\\n### Wouldn\u2019t you expect to see breakthrough infections in a group such as a sports team?  \\n\\nIt is not surprising that members of the same sports team could experience breakthrough infections. It\'s basically a mini outbreak among a group of people who are probably in very close contact without masking, without social distancing, and so if they\u2019ve got the virus transmitted among them, that\u2019s going to increase the risk. Plus the team is getting tested far more often than the general public.  \\n\\nThe important message is that none of the players got severe disease. Some were actually asymptomatic.  \\n\\nBottom line is that breakthrough infections are expected but they\u2019re also rare.

As shown for Maryland below, one of the new graphics highlights the proportion of people in the state who are *\u201cpartially vaccinated\u201d* versus *\u201cfully vaccinated.\u201d* The CRC considers a person *partially vaccinated* if they have not completed the full dosing regimen for their vaccine type. This metric is critical to gauging an area\u2019s level of vaccination since the number of doses administered does not directly correlate with the total number of people fully vaccinated because some vaccines require two doses. The *partially vaccinated* proportion also helps track if people are not completing the dosing regimen, which is becoming more common<sup>1</sup> and requires targeted outreach to solve.  \\n\\n![MD-Partially-Vax]()  \\n\\nThe percentage of a population *fully vaccinated* continues to be key in assessing countries\u2019 vaccination efforts. The world is not safe until everyone is vaccinated. The majority of global vaccination data acquired by the CRC have been sufficiently detailed to be useful so far. To appropriately classify the person as *\u201cpartially vaccinated\u201d* or *\u201cfully vaccinated,\u201d* we need to know whether the person received a 1-dose or 2-dose vaccine and which dose they most recently received. However, the amount and types of meta-information required to categorize vaccination data points will change soon due to **booster shots** and **mixed vaccine schedules**.  \\n\\n![Just-Flowchart]()  \\n\\n### Booster Shots  \\n\\nBooster shots are likely coming. The timeline is unclear, but manufacturers have begun announcing that additional doses could be needed.<sup>2</sup> Although the CDC and FDA say that it is not time for booster shots in the United States,<sup>3</sup> Israel, which was a leader in the COVID-19 vaccination rollout,<sup>4</sup> recently began administering booster shots to its immunocompromised sub-populations<sup>5</sup> and those over the age of 60.<sup>6</sup> As of July 22nd, detailed data on booster shots administered were not available on Israel\u2019s COVID-19 dashboard. With the addition of booster doses, vaccination data reporting will need to expand to identify fully vaccinated populations. The dose number alone will not be sufficient to categorize people as fully vaccinated and the complications of additional shots necessitate vaccination metadata becoming more detailed. We can only properly track a country\u2019s vaccinated population if information on all doses ever received is available.  \\n\\n### Mixed Vaccine Schedules  \\n\\nSome countries are also considering administering different vaccines at subsequent vaccinations. Thailand has given AstraZeneca vaccines to those who already received the Sinovac vaccine<sup>7</sup>. The data on those individuals has not been published on Thailand\u2019s COVID-19 dashboard as of July 22nd. Even if uncommon, mixed vaccine schedules add a new requisite to vaccine metadata \u2013 manufacturer types for each vaccine dose.  \\n\\nMixing vaccine types was not formally evaluated in phase 3 clinical trials but may be sound scientifically<sup>8</sup>, and merits further study and continued observation. The timeline for additional doses may also be different between manufacturer types, so the transition of a group from \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d back to \u201cpartially vaccinated\u201d when booster shots are recommended will be impossible to determine if countries do not report both the manufacturer of individuals\u2019 first doses and the manufacturers of individuals\u2019 subsequent doses.  \\n\\n### Thought Experiment  \\n\\n![Current-Vaccine-Data-Flow-Crop]()  \\n\\nTo highlight the importance of detailed metadata, let\u2019s say a country reports that a dose of the Pfizer vaccine (a 2-dose vaccine) was administered as a second dose to someone recorded as having received the first Pfizer dose weeks earlier (situation A above). That data point contains sufficient metainformation to classify the person as *\u201cfully vaccinated.\u201d* However, a different country simply reports that they administered a single dose of the Pfizer vaccine (situation B above) without documenting whether the person had previously received another dose. We cannot identify if that data point constitutes a *\u201cpartially vaccinated\u201d* or *\u201cfully vaccinated\u201d* person, making the reported data difficult to interpret.  \\n\\n![Future-Vaccine-Data-Flow]()  \\n\\nWith the addition of mixed vaccines schedules and booster shots, we will need more information in each vaccination data point to appropriately categorize vaccination status. Knowing that the requirements to be fully vaccinated will be more complicated, one country (situation A above) reports that it administered one dose of the Pfizer vaccine to someone who already received one Pfizer dose. This information is sufficient to classify the person as \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d with the caveat that one day they may need a booster shot. No additional information is needed for classification. However, a second country, with lackluster data standards, simply reports someone came to a clinic for their second dose (situation B above). Without knowing the vaccine manufacturer, we don\u2019t know if this person mixed vaccine types or will need a booster. The level of detail in the data as currently reported is insufficient.  \\n\\nGiven these considerations, we have a critical opportunity to prepare for changes in the data reporting needs before they occur. With global economies, international travel, and the general welfare of humanity hinging on vaccination rates in every country, we need to establish rigorous vaccination data reporting policies if we want to cross borders once again.   \\n\\n**As we enter this next phase of pandemic response, vaccination data needs to include information on vaccine type, manufacturer, and dose number.** We have the roadmap to high-quality vaccination data \u2013 let\u2019s follow it together.  \\n\\n---  \\n\\nReferences  \\n\\n1.

Pfizer is now seeking emergency use authorization from U.S. regulators to distribute a booster shot developed for its COVID-19 vaccine. Few experts are advocating for boosters while more than half of the U.S. population remains unvaccinated.","content":"\u201cAmericans who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 do not need a booster shot at this time. FDA, CDC, and NIH are engaged in a science-based, rigorous process to consider whether or when a booster might be necessary,\u201d the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration said in a recent joint statement. \u201cVirtually all COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths are among those who are unvaccinated. We encourage Americans who have not yet been vaccinated to get vaccinated as soon as possible to protect themselves and their community.\u201d  \\n\\n### Will booster shots be required, or will that depend on the original vaccine?  \\n\\nThere is no need or recommendation for booster doses for people who are fully immunized in the United States. This will be a decision by the FDA and CDC with input from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. These are the expert groups that will make the decision when and for whom booster doses are needed.  \\n\\nThere are two reasons why we might need booster doses. One would be if we see waning immunity and a loss of protection over time from the original vaccine. But we haven\u2019t seen evidence of that yet.  \\n\\nThe other reason would be the threat that new variants could escape the immunity conferred by vaccines. There is some evidence of slight decreases in protective efficacy, but the current portfolio of vaccines is very effective against severe disease, hospitalization, and death. I don\u2019t foresee a need for booster doses in the near future for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. But it\u2019s possible that some people, such as those who are immunosuppressed at the time of vaccination or the elderly, may require booster doses earlier than the general population.  \\n\\n> \u2018There is no need or recommendation for booster doses for people who are fully immunized in the United States.\u2019\\n\\nThe bottom line for people to take away is that the currently authorized vaccines in the United States remain highly protective against severe disease due to all of the known variants and particularly the Delta variant.  \\n\\n### Why does Pfizer believe booster doses may be needed?  \\n\\nPfizer is drawing this conclusion, in part, based on some recent data presented by Israel\u2019s ministry of health showing the efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine decline from about 90% to 64%. It\u2019s unclear how generalizable that is. There are other studies suggesting that the protective effectiveness remains high \u2013 maybe a little lower than what was seen in the Phase III trials against earlier variants. But certainly, it remains high against severe disease. We\u2019re just going to need to monitor this.  \\n\\nPfizer did say that it has evidence that a third dose of the Pfizer vaccine really boosts antibody responses and that they\u2019ll be seeking emergency use authorization and that they are working on vaccines that specifically target the Delta variant, as is Moderna.  \\n\\n### Can mixing different vaccines strengthen immunity?  \\n\\nThere is evidence that mixed vaccine regimens can be very immunogenic, particularly when looking at various combinations of the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines.  \\n\\nEarly reports of individuals who got the AstraZeneca first and Pfizer second had very strong immune responses with high antibody levels. So, it looks like that combination of vaccines could be very worthwhile.  \\n\\n### Has the CDC offered any guidance about boosters?  \\n\\nThe CDC has not come out with recommendations on booster doses, and specifically for people who have gotten the single-shot J&J vaccine. I think they do need to come out with some kind of statement soon even in the absence of evidence, particularly for those who received a single dose of the J&J vaccine. People are asking the question and are going forward with getting booster doses with mRNA vaccines.  \\n\\nWe know that the J&J vaccine was less effective against the Beta variant in South Africa than other vaccines. We know that the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines are slightly less effective in protecting against symptomatic disease due to the Delta variant when given as two doses and markedly less effective with just one dose. That at least raises some concern about the J&J vaccine and the Delta variant. We know that with another adenovirus vaccine \u2013 the AstraZeneca one \u2013 that you get a very strong immune response when boosted with Pfizer.  \\n\\n> \u2018We need to focus on increasing vaccination coverage in the United States not on strategies for developing boosters for those already vaccinated\u2019  \\n\\nThus, there is circumstantial evidence that at least raises a very legitimate question about whether people who got the J&J vaccine should get a booster dose with the mRNA vaccines.  \\n\\nNow, Johnson & Johnson recently announced new laboratory data based on a small number of blood samples that showed its single-shot vaccine generated neutralizing antibodies against the Delta and other variants, up to at least eight months. So, hopefully booster doses will not be necessary to protect against disease due to the Delta variant.  \\n \\nThe [National Institutes of Health](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-clinical-trial-evaluating-mixed-covid-19-vaccine-schedules-begins) is funding a study looking at mixing Moderna, Pfizer, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines with a booster dose of the Moderna vaccine.  \\n\\n### How would you determine who needs a booster shot if they got one dose of the J&J vaccine?  \\n\\nIf a person who got a single dose of J&J is living in a community with high vaccine coverage and where case counts are low, it would be prudent for that individual to wait for more evidence or recommendations from the CDC.  \\n\\nHowever, in the absence of better data, if the person with a single shot J&J vaccine lives in a community with low vaccination coverage and where the number of cases is increasing due to the Delta variant \u2013 it would be reasonable for that person to take a couple of steps. First, they should be practicing common sense public health measures such as masking and avoiding crowded areas. Second, it might be prudent to get a second dose with an mRNA vaccine knowing that there is no evidence supporting that and there are no CDC recommendations for it.  \\n\\n### Would the Novavax vaccine be deployed as a booster?  \\n\\nNovavax could play an important role in boosters when and if we need them.  \\n\\nNovavax could also play a role in encouraging more people to get vaccinated. I\u2019ve heard anecdotally that people may be more likely to get vaccinated with Novavax because they\u2019re not comfortable with the mRNA vaccines, which are a new vaccine technology although they have been in development for two decades. I don\u2019t know if that is going to really move the needle in terms of convincing more people to get vaccinated, but it\u2019s possible.  \\n\\nNovavax is a more traditional vaccine platform. Instead of providing the genetic recipe for our own cells to make the spike protein, which is done with the mRNA and adenovirus vector vaccines, it simply injects the protein itself along with something that stimulates our immune system. There are many examples of this type of vaccine that people are more familiar with, such as the tetanus and diphtheria vaccines. They inject a protein that the immune system identifies and then develops an immune response to.  \\n\\n> \u2018Novavax could also play a role in encouraging more people to get vaccinated.\u2019  \\n\\nWhat was striking and remarkable was the overall high 90% efficacy that we have seen with the Novavax vaccine. It\u2019s slightly lower than what we\u2019ve seen with the mRNA vaccines, but higher than the adenovirus vector vaccines. There was also high protective efficacy in high-risk adults and some of the variants of interest and concern. We don\u2019t know how it will perform against Delta but there was somewhat decreased efficacy against the Beta variant.  \\n\\nOn the global scale we need every vaccine we can get.  With such a high efficacy vaccine that doesn\u2019t require extremely cold temperatures to store and ship it, Novavax could be a major benefit to getting more vaccines to other countries.  \\n","legacyIsNew":false,"isDrafted":null,"order":0,"date":"07/12/21","attachments":[],"verticals":[],"authors":["william-moss"]},{"id":65,"slug":"80-million-donated-vaccine-doses-too-little-too-late","meta":{"path":"/vaccines/report/80-million-donated-vaccine-doses-too-little-too-late","title":"Q&A: 80 Million Donated Vaccine Doses: Too Little, Too Late?

The United States has now authorized children as young as 12 years old to be vaccinated while the most vulnerable adults in many other nations still lack vaccine access. It\u2019s a complicated question. William Moss, vaccinology lead for the CRC and executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center, discusses the need for the United States to exert worldwide leadership in fighting the global pandemic.  ","content":"### Is the U.S. donation of 80 million doses enough to make a global difference?  \\n\\nNo, it\u2019s far from adequate. It\u2019s a small step in the right direction. It\u2019s a good gesture. But the United States needs to play a much bigger role if we\u2019re going to address the global vaccine inequities between high and middle- and low-income countries. The [world vaccination map](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/vaccines/international) on the Coronavirus Resource Center website provides a stark illustration of how vaccines are being administered in richer nations far faster than anywhere else.  \\n\\n### Is there a number that would provide the world with a serious infusion of vaccines?  \\n\\nThere isn\u2019t a specific number, but for context here is one way to think about it. There are 8 billion people in the world. Each one would need two shots. That\u2019s 16 billion doses. Say we want to vaccinate 70% of the world population to really try to stop this pandemic \u2013 that\'s more than 11 billion doses. Now you can see how 20 million or 60 million or 80 million doses is really a trivial amount considering the challenge ahead for the world.  \\n\\nMy understanding is that there are several hundred million doses available each month in the United States. An 80 million donation is a drop in the bucket.  \\n\\n### How can the United States get those doses into the arms of citizens of other nations?  \\n\\nThere are three strategies that countries can follow for vaccine donations overseas.  \\n\\nThe first is to deliver them through the COVAX Facility, which I think is the best. That\u2019s the primary global mechanism for getting vaccines to low- and middle-income nations. They use equity to determine where to deliver the vaccines, with the number of doses proportional to the population size. COVAX is thus the most equitable. The Biden Administration said it would be supporting the COVAX Facility, so that\u2019s a good thing.  \\n\\n> \u2018A donation of 80 million vaccine doses is a trivial amount considering the challenge ahead for the world.\u2019  \\n\\nA second strategy is to target hotspots and emerging hotspots. For example, some of those doses are going to be targeted to India, which is facing a tragic surge in cases. The idea is to get vaccines to where they are needed most. But it has to be done early. That\u2019s the trick and the challenge with that approach.  \\n\\nAnd then the third strategy is based on foreign policy decisions. This is my least favorite. For example, the Biden Administration has donated doses to Canada and Mexico, obviously because they are countries on our borders where we have a self-interest in preventing virus importations.  \\n\\n### Is there enough time to deliver the vaccines to make a difference?  \\n\\nWell, with India, I must say, it\'s late. Technically, it\u2019s never really too late but vaccines take time to be administered and to work so they\u2019re not a short-term solution. But right now it\u2019s so far behind the curve. Let\u2019s say all 60 million of the AstraZeneca doses go to India. It\u2019s going to take some time to even get those doses into people. Then you need to give them two doses. And then you\u2019re not fully immunized until two weeks later. That\u2019s really a strategy to help two months down the line not during a terrible surge in cases. Not that it\u2019s wrong to do this, but you have to temper your expectations as to what it is going to do.  \\n\\nYou can look at where outbreaks are really emerging like in Nepal or Thailand to target vaccine doses.  \\n\\n### What more can the United States do to address the global situation?  \\n\\nThe United States needs to do a lot more than donating vaccines. That\u2019s just one part of a portfolio in addressing global vaccine inequities. The United States needs to support the expansion of vaccine manufacturing both domestically and abroad. It needs to help build that capacity, provide training for personnel, and relax export restrictions on supplies, reagents, and chemicals that go into manufacturing vaccines.  \\n\\nThis needs to be a global partnership among the wealthy nations to coordinate all of the responses needed.  \\n\\n> \u2018The U.S. needs to do a lot more than donating vaccines to address global vaccine inequities.\u2019\\n\\nIt is in the self-interest of the United States to do this because we are always going to be at risk of importing SARS-CoV-2, and the risk of importing variants for which our current vaccines may be less effective. It\u2019s really enlightened self-interest to try to reduce transmission and to get this pandemic under control everywhere. We need to substantially reduce the burden of disease for humanitarian purposes and reduce transmission of the virus for self-interest to prevent the emergence of variants that could cause outbreaks in the United States.  \\n\\nWe are already at a point in the United States where we have a surplus of vaccines. Obviously we expanded eligibility for children 12 to 15 years old, and this will increase our need. But the demand is decreasing among  adults in the United States and we\u2019re going to have excess doses.  \\n\\nTo date 1.7 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses have been produced. We\u2019re still at a small fraction of what is needed to vaccinate the world and we\u2019re not going to get much of the world vaccinated until 2023. This needs to be an urgent and collaborative global effort.  \\n \\n### Can surplus vaccines be used as booster shots later?  \\n\\nI believe that is one of the reasons why there has been some reluctance to donate a large number of doses. It\u2019s still a bit uncertain about the timing and need for booster doses. Many experts believe we will need them. The question is when. The Biden Administration justifiably has been focused on bringing the pandemic under control in the United States. It does not want to put the United States into a shortage, which I think is reasonable. But the United States still need to be a global leader in addressing global vaccine inequities.  \\n\\nThe United States will need to maintain a supply of vaccine for potential booster doses. Now if there is a new variant that is driving the need for additional vaccine doses, we could use the current vaccine as a booster, but we may also need a new vaccine created specifically to target a variant.\\n","legacyIsNew":false,"isDrafted":null,"order":0,"date":"05/26/21","attachments":[],"verticals":[],"authors":["william-moss"]},{"id":62,"slug":"johns-hopkins-covid-19-effort-provides-roadmap","meta":{"path":"/pandemic-data-initiative/news/johns-hopkins-covid-19-effort-provides-roadmap","title":"Johns Hopkins COVID-19 Effort Provides Roadmap","description":"Evolution of Coronavirus Resource Center reveals the pitfalls and possible paths toward uniform data reporting","image":"/images/assets/62_3fea13c2d6.jpg"},"section":"Data Solutions","title":"Johns Hopkins COVID-19 Effort Provides Roadmap","subtitle":"","caption":"Evolution of Coronavirus Resource Center reveals the pitfalls and possible paths toward uniform data reporting","content":"It is not easy to build a data management system that can reliably collect, examine, clean, and report massive amounts of critical information such as the national and international spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nIt\u2019s especially difficult when every U.S. state and the federal government -- not to mention all the nations of the world -- have slightly or vastly different methods for gathering and sharing such data.

We must prepare for the threat of cyberattacks implanting disinformation to discredit dashboards and confuse the public.","content":"COVID-19 dashboards across the globe have been the victims of cybercriminals executing ransomware attacks. The data contained in dashboards is critical to ongoing public health efforts, making them high-value targets for ransomware and more sophisticated disinformation attackers. Dr. Thomas Rid, a professor of strategic studies at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, has studied the disruptive power of cyberattacks through election interference and believes there are parallels to be drawn with COVID-19 data dissemination efforts.  \\n\\n### What is the relevance of cybersecurity to COVID-19 data?  \\n\\nI often apply a basic concept to understand the various components of data security \u2014 the CIA triad. C stands for confidentiality, I for integrity, and A for availability. If we\'re looking at COVID-19 dashboards then what\'s really important here is the I and the A because the data doesn\'t contain personally identifiable information, even on the back end, making confidentiality less of a concern. Information has to be available to understand how COVID-19 is evolving, and it has to be trustworthy. Cybersecurity helps ensure those outcomes. \\n\\n### Are ransomware attacks on international COVID-19 dashboards a major concern?  \\n\\nRansomware attacks are serious and stressful to deal with, but they aren\u2019t as concerning as suddenly finding out that you\'re being targeted by a high-profile intelligence agency. The motivation of a ransomware attack is simply profit, so it\'s less insidious than an intelligence agency trying to infiltrate and falsify information.\\n\\nThere is a long history of health emergencies being targeted by disinformation actors. The current pandemic, of course, is highly politicized, both domestically and internationally. Highly influential dashboards could become the subjects of attempted disinformation attacks. That means not shutting them down, but changing the information displayed on them, either to undermine the credibility of science, or to further a desired narrative. The key distinction between a ransomware attack and a disinformation attack is that you quickly find out about a ransomware attack because the attackers want you to pay a ransom. An integrity attack attempts to change data covertly and go undetected, at least for a while.  \\n\\nJohns Hopkins has raised its profile significantly through the CRC dashboard. With that comes even more public credibility and trust. In a way, a ransomware attack would be less harmful than some form of integrity attack because an integrity attack is ultimately an attack on trust, your reputation, and your name. There are no backups for reputational harm.  \\n\\n> \u201cIt\'s extremely important to guard against integrity attacks on dashboards because they would attack the core of who we are.\u201d  \\n\\n### How can you secure the integrity of health information on a dashboard?  \\n\\nFirst, by making it as hard as possible to hack into the dashboards by adhering to cybersecurity best practices. Additionally, you should have a chain of custody on the back end so that you can reconstruct the data that you\'re displaying at all times. The database that feeds into the dashboard, for instance, should always have an up-to-date backup, so you can easily reconstruct the public facing component of the data if needed. It may also be prudent to monitor or sample data integrity in a coherent way.  \\n\\nWhen I write an article, I do the research and keep everything on my computer. If someone changes my data after publication, I can reconstruct the original, unmodified article because I have a track record of the earlier drafts and my methods to arrive at the conclusions or data points. The same process should exist for COVID-19 dashboards, and probably does.  \\n\\n### Is it more secure to have 50 separate dashboards or one central data repository?  \\n\\nIn the election context, you sometimes hear the argument that the United States has thousands of separate elections because precincts have their own reporting techniques and routines. Similarly, many local entities have their own COVID-19 dashboards. Decentralization only means that the attack surface is larger, and that an attacker needs more work to execute a successful attack at scale. Some attackers are very well resourced, so you\u2019re not increasing security by making the process more labor intensive. On the other hand, if you have a bottleneck or a single point of failure, that makes it easier for the attacker. It\'s a trade-off. Scale-up and centralization have significant security advantages, but they also come with weaknesses. Centralization alone is not necessarily a cybersecurity risk.\\n\\n### Due to the threat of misinformation, should data still be shared publicly?  \\n\\nWe need reliable public information in order to confront the pandemic and develop countermeasures. At the same time, we need to be sure that the data that we see on the dashboards is credible and nobody has interfered with the integrity of that information. Having a breach is one thing, but discovering the breach is another. We need to be alert and have systems and products in place to discover breaches quickly. The trick of an integrity attack is keeping a low profile. You want to display information that looks as if it\'s accurate. In fact, we have examples of that in the context of election interference, where data has been deftly manipulated to highlight a specific candidate. This manipulation of information to display a different result could definitely occur with COVID-19 dashboards. \\n\\n### How should the CRC and other COVID-19 dashboards prepare for data integrity attacks?  \\n\\nCOVID-19 has become highly politicized in the United States and internationally, putting dashboards on the target list for entities that are interested in disinformation. Johns Hopkins is a high-value target. We have individuals, organizations, and projects targeted by high-profile intelligence agencies. I have seen Johns Hopkins email addresses on the target lists of state-sponsored espionage groups in the past. It should be assumed that we could become the target of sophisticated attackers.  \\n\\n> \u201cBest security practices are not just what everybody thinks of in terms of two-factor authentication and updating your systems \u2014 it\'s the simple things that matter most.\u201d  \\n\\nMany in cybersecurity think that sophisticated adversaries hack better, have better exploits, and have better tools and software, but that\'s only half the picture. Sophisticated adversaries go after human beings. They basically recruit people working on the inside of the organizations they target. We absolutely have to assume that this is going on at the nation\u2019s top research institutes, including at universities. Countering a sophisticated adversary intent on spreading disinformation is different from countering a ransomware group looking to profit. We should prepare for those threats.","legacyIsNew":false,"isDrafted":null,"order":0,"date":"08/04/21","attachments":["/images/assets/PDI_Rid_d0d4cb1108.jpg"],"verticals":["pandemic-data-initiative"],"authors":["joshua-e-porterfield-ph-d"]},{"id":95,"slug":"private-patient-data-best-practice-not-always-best-for-progress","meta":{"path":"/pandemic-data-initiative/news/private-patient-data-best-practice-not-always-best-for-progress","title":"Private Patient Data: Best Practice Not Always Best for Progress","description":"Medical data is currently privately owned and difficult for researchers outside of the institution to access, hindering progress and collaboration.","image":"/images/assets/pdi_8_9_21_d975a6f855.jpg"},"section":"Pandemic Data Outlook","title":"Private Patient Data: Best Practice Not Always Best for Progress","subtitle":null,"caption":"Medical data is often housed in private, proprietary repositories accessible primarily by the medical institute where the data were created. This may hinder research by limiting the scope of studies and preventing streamlined collaborative efforts. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for more robust medical data sharing and collaboration, and it is time to consider uniting these data systems.","content":"An emerging theme in our Covid-19 data work, recently highlighted with [Dr. Elizabeth Ogburn](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/pandemic-data-initiative/news/grassroots-fervor-for-large-scale-data-collaboration) and coming up again this Wednesday with Dr. Daniel Polsky, is that sequestered, private data repositories can be obstacles to academic research and medical progress. These isolated systems have been established to protect patient privacy, but [Dr. Thomas Rid explained](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/pandemic-data-initiative/news/securing-covid-19-data-confidentiality-integrity-and-availability) that centralization of data streams alone does not put patients at risk, particularly if personally identifying information is removed on the front end. With that knowledge, the benefits of combining medical data streams to provide better information to researchers and clinicians far outweigh the theoretical risks.  \\n\\nHospital-level data that would include valuable metrics on comorbidities and demographics is often unavailable even to academic researchers at peer medical institutions. For example, a researcher at Duke University Medical Center cannot easily access anonymized data from the Johns Hopkins Health System. This curtails the power of analyses performed at an individual institution and limits the scope of conclusions that can be drawn and applied to medical practice. Bringing together hospital data streams is known as unified data management, and has been a topic of discussion globally for years.<sup>1-3</sup> The COVID-19 pandemic has proven that we should consider going even further than unified data management by centralizing anonymized patient data for research purposes.  \\n\\nThere are benefits to institutional ownership of private data repositories with minimal external access. The more people that have access to such databases, the more susceptible they are to cyberattack.<sup>4</sup> The United States has a history of medical data being used to dox and harass individual patients from the HIV/AIDS epidemic<sup>5</sup> to COVID-19,<sup>6</sup> so protection of patient privacy is critical and these databases must continue to be staunchly defended. However, if medical institutions have similar privacy requirements and systems, couldn\u2019t one data system communicate with another?  \\n\\nInstitutions support their own research faculty and staff who must publish or perish<sup>7</sup> by maintaining strict access to in-house data. For example, if a researcher at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute publishes a study that utilizes data from the Mayo Clinic, then researchers at the Mayo Clinic can no longer publish the same type of study with those data. If Dana-Farber researchers were not allowed to access Mayo Clinic data, then researchers at the Mayo Clinic are guaranteed to be the first to publish a paper on the data (if they ever do).  \\n\\nAccess to less data limits the power of analysis and the generalizability of conclusions. With 1,000 data points from a single hospital, a subtle difference may not be visible or statistically significant. On the other hand, analyzing 100,000 data points from hospitals across the country would enable researchers to identify whether a subtle trend is real and significant. Additionally, conclusions in scientific research can only be drawn based on the data used in the study. A larger cross-section of people \u2014 ideally from throughout the entire country \u2014 would potentially allow more powerful conclusions to be drawn.  \\n\\n[With Dr. Kathryn McDonald](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/pandemic-data-initiative/news/making-data-driven-healthcare-decisions-with-covid-19), we envisioned that the United States could have a database of medical databases to foster collaboration and data verification, allowing healthcare centers across the country to access powerful, updated data to inform their practices. This idea could be further expanded to develop a centralized database of anonymized patient data for immediate access to aggregated datasets containing data representative of the diversity across the country.  \\n\\nAnother confounding element of medical data is that electronic health records (EHRs) do not always enable physicians to record metadata in a translatable way. As [Dr. Brian Garibaldi explained in our PDI interview](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/pandemic-data-initiative/news/q-and-a-data-driven-precision-medicine-is-the-future-of-patient-care), EHRs need to be programmed with additional metrics to prevent critical information from being registered simply as text that cannot be aggregated, searched for, or compared between patients. If institutions have a more collaborative data environment, EHR updates developed at individual hospitals can be shared and adapted to ensure the best data are collected for every patient in the country.  \\n\\nI don\u2019t have a solution for our disconnected medical data systems. I know the systems are not working as well as they could and that we may be hindering life-saving medical research by continuing to act independently and hold data privately. Leaders in medicine, research, data, and cybersecurity should work together to propose a path forward. And, of course, **patient privacy must continue to be protected, no matter what.**  \\n\\nThus far, we have seen only minor success in federal mandates for reporting of medical data. COVID-19 hospitalization data is one of the cleanest data streams available because the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services required standardization and regular reporting.<sup>8,9</sup> Optional reporting systems to the federal government through the CDC have resulted in lag and disparities between state-reported data and federally-reported data. Outside of COVID-19, the United States has only taken small steps towards unified data management, for example by providing financial incentives for hospitals to utilize EHRs.<sup>10</sup>  \\n\\nWe have reached a moment where our world-class medical and academic organizations should work towards enabling and supporting inter-institutional data sharing and research without waiting for the federal government to take the lead. As we have seen throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, collaboration, transparency, and access to data are more important than ever. If we unite under that belief, we can find a path forward to unite our data systems in an ethical, responsible, and mutually beneficial way.  \\n\\n---  \\n\\nReferences  \\n1. K.

Scientific advances have enabled rapid, affordable sequencing of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and its variants, but now we must learn how to communicate these findings and establish lasting sequencing efforts to protect us from novel viral and bacterial infections.","content":"Dr. Winston Timp is a professor of biomedical engineering in the Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering and the co-lead of the Johns Hopkins viral genomics effort. His work focuses on utilizing the power of genetic sequencing data to better defend against bacteria, viruses, and other infectious diseases.  \\n\\n### Why is it important to continue sequencing COVID-19 data?  \\n\\nSequencing is essential to respond to and design tests for novel infectious diseases, but it\'s also important for surveillance. First, if the virus mutates in such a way that current testing becomes invalid because the sequence we\u2019re probing against no longer works, sequencing should be able to still detect the virus and provide data for us to adapt and design new assays. Second, the mutations that we see in the virus can be used to track how and from where the virus is spreading. Finally, it\'s also useful to identify variants of concern.  \\n\\n### How do you communicate sequencing data about variants without sparking panic?  \\n\\nI want to emphasize that the vaccines in the U.S. are still very effective at producing a strong immune response to all known COVID-19 variants. People who are fully vaccinated have a much lower risk of getting infected by even the Delta variant, and they seem to have a much lower risk of severe COVID-19 requiring ICU hospitalization. Yet, the data still suggests that the Delta variant is more transmissible. People should be aware of that so if needed we can reintroduce mitigation strategies such as masking. However, if your area\u2019s vaccination rate is high and the case count is low there shouldn\'t be a lot of concern. Explaining this clearly is difficult because it requires a clear science communication strategy to explain to people the differences and what the actual risk is.  \\n\\n> \u201cWe need to explain the significance of variants clearly so people are aware and informed, but this should be driven by data, not fear.\u201d  \\n\\nIt\'s not just science communication to the layperson, but it\'s also science communication to clinical and public health folks and vice versa. We have to bridge the gap between researchers and clinicians, so that data can be interpreted, leveraged, and used by all. On the science and academic side there is plenty of data on COVID-19, but we have to make sure that that information is flowing out in a useful and organized manner. We need to know what clinicians need, so we can develop the right tools to answer the right questions and address the most critical needs of patients.  \\n\\n### How has the availability of sequencing data changed public health?  \\n\\nIt\'s a combination of technological and computational development that prepared us to deliver data rapidly. The first reported cases of COVID-19 were in October 2019. The first genome for SARS-CoV-2 was shared publicly in January 2020. This is an unprecedented speed of data analysis. From that genome, public health agencies across the world were able to design testing for the virus and start vaccine development.  \\n\\nThe challenges we ran into from the sequencing were generally not related to the sequencing itself, but in logistics organization and meta-information wrangling from human samples. The sequencing itself was relatively trivial and actually quite boring. The cost for sequencing has gone substantially down, and the technology is solidly established. That\'s why this is different than before.  \\n\\n> \u201cWe have the tools, skill, and scientific community to acquire sequencing data rapidly and easily, but we didn\'t get here easily.\u201d  \\n\\n### Is genetic sequencing part of a robust public health data infrastructure?  \\n\\n[Dr. Michael Schatz described standing public health data infrastructure as a \u201cdigital immune system.\u201d](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3617452/) We should be monitoring cases coming in and watching for red flags. That infrastructure should be set up and continuously funded so public health agencies can watch for not just COVID-19 variants and new viruses, but also bacteria and other infections. If we find cases of bacterial infections resistant to third-line antibiotics, we should be sequencing them to figure out where the antimicrobial resistance is coming from and how to shut it down. The more methods we have to analyze what\'s making us sick, the better we can respond.  \\n\\n### Why have U.S. sequencing data collection efforts lagged behind other nations?  \\n\\nThere were three things standing in the way: having the logistics setup, having the political will to do it, and establishing clear communication between all the invested parties with differing backgrounds, including the public. At the beginning of the pandemic, individual institutions were interested in getting sequencing to happen in the United States, there was no will at high government levels to engage in it. That has changed and I think it\'s still important for the United States to have this setup for the next crisis so we\'re ready, but also so that we can monitor for variants of concern.  \\n\\nEfforts from the CDC in recent months have been instrumental in turning the focus to sequencing and organizing the systems to continue and provide public health departments with access to this technology. Most state public health departments weren\'t set up to collect sequencing data, so now with the help of the CDC they\'re getting paired with either commercial providers or academic core providers to help with sequencing. They could also be involved in the creation and maintenance of a centralized database with well-regulated, well-curated meta-information fields, but how the data is being provided and used will have to be very transparent.  \\n\\n### What obstacles prevent cross-correlation analyses based on sequencing data?  \\n\\nThere are privacy concerns even though viral sequencing data is less personal than human genomic sequencing data. Meta-information such as the date a patient went to the hospital or their sex, zip code, or age could serve to dox them in the case of a variant outbreak that leads back to them. Privacy is important, but it is also a hindrance to analysis. What if I want to know if this variant only affects a subset of the population? I can\u2019t figure it out without meta-information.  \\n\\n> \u201cAs a scientist, I prefer to have all data freely accessible to everyone, but I know that\'s not always the right answer.\u201d  \\n\\nThis is outside of my purview to solve. It comes down to ethics. Our problems could be overcome by a system that ensures a balance between both individual privacy and improved public health, but I don\u2019t know what that system would look like. It is an immense challenge that we should be coming together to solve, and better communication will be necessary.\\n","legacyIsNew":false,"isDrafted":null,"order":0,"date":"07/14/21","attachments":["/images/assets/WT_7_14_21_26f723e9a5.jpg"],"verticals":["pandemic-data-initiative"],"authors":["joshua-e-porterfield-ph-d"]},{"id":64,"slug":"where-s-unvaccinated-waldo","meta":{"path":"/pandemic-data-initiative/news/where-s-unvaccinated-waldo","title":"Where\u2019s (Unvaccinated) Waldo?","description":"Detailed data of vaccine distribution in near real time could have improved the government\u2019s ability to identify hotspots and reach inaccessible populations","image":"/images/assets/image1_ac6dc202d6.png"},"section":"Pandemic Data Outlook","title":"Where\u2019s (Unvaccinated) Waldo?","subtitle":"","caption":"A Data-Driven Approach Can Enhance COVID-19 Vaccine Rollout  \\n\\nDetailed data of vaccine distribution in near real time could have improved the government\u2019s ability to identify hotspots and reach inaccessible populations ","content":"We are reaching a plateau in vaccine administration much earlier than anticipated<sup>1</sup>. As of May 18, 2021, [there are 112.7 million Americans fully vaccinated](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/vaccines/us-states), which still leaves over 62% of Americans requiring at least one more COVID-19 vaccine dose. The vaccination rollout could have more effectively utilized prior data, and collected new data, to better inform distribution strategies and aid in this \u201clast leg\u201d of vaccination \u2013 identifying and reaching out to the unvaccinated.  \\n\\n[U.S. Vaccination Efforts](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/vaccines/us-states) \\n\\n### How did we get here?  \\n\\nIt has been made clear throughout the COVID-19 pandemic that the U.S. public health data infrastructure is lacking at best. Since COVID-19 was first detected in the United States in January 2020, testing, positivity, death, and hospitalization [data have been nebulous, missing, and/or incompatible](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/23/opinion/coronavirus-testing.html) between states. The vaccination rollout that began in December 2020 provided an opportunity for the U.S. to learn from those prior missteps and pursue clear, uniform data collection standards. Unfortunately, that has not been the case.  \\n\\nIn defense of the CDC and public health and political leaders that developed and implemented vaccination strategies, the pandemic, vaccine development, and vaccine deployment have progressed at an unprecedented pace, making it difficult to plan. That is not to say that we could not and did not prepare for this. In 2018 the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) released Allocating and Targeting Pandemic Influenza Vaccine During an Influenza Pandemic<sup>2</sup>. This document laid out the plans for distribution of a new vaccine, including who should be prioritized, during a novel influenza pandemic.  \\n\\nWhile COVID-19 is not the flu, these guidelines are an excellent framework for vaccine preparedness and the establishment of data infrastructure. Additionally, during the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple non-government organizations including the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health<sup>3</sup>, produced **guidelines** for how to ethically and effectively distribute a new COVID-19 vaccine. Those detailed plans offered many contingencies for what were unknowns at the time, including who was most affected by COVID-19, how many vaccines would be available, and how many doses would be required per person.  \\n\\nThe foundation for an extraordinary vaccine rollout existed, so why are we now struggling to vaccinate the remainder of the country, and what could data do to help us?  \\n\\n### Sharing Information with and Access to All Citizens  \\n\\nGiven that you are currently reading this on a device that is connected to the internet, it may be difficult to conceive of the significant population of Americans that cannot access a computer due to either financial or personal reasons, do not have broadband internet connectivity due to their rural location, or do not have the technological literacy necessary to utilize vaccine registration systems. Even if people can access a computer, they may not have a personal vehicle or reliable public transportation to get to a vaccination appointment. These obstacles unequally impact Americans experiencing financial hardship, which is particularly disconcerting when it has been shown that COVID-19 has disproportionately affected those in poverty<sup>4</sup>.  \\n\\nWhile President Biden proposes to address broadband internet access as part of his administration\u2019s American Jobs Plan<sup>5</sup>, 23% of Americans do not currently have access to broadband internet at home as of February 2021<sup>6</sup>, which is a necessity for vaccine registration in almost every state. Pockets of people without broadband could be generally located through public data on regional internet access, as well as individual computer ownership<sup>7</sup>. Computer literacy is more difficult to gauge with data, although census data regarding age could at least identify the locations of populations more likely to have difficulties using computers. With this information, states could have designed vaccine registration systems accessible by phone and/or created mobile vaccine registration units to help people in areas with no broadband access register for vaccination. Data on public transportation and personal vehicle registration from state departments of motor vehicles could have helped plan vaccination site locations and mobile vaccine unit deployment to reach this impoverished, inaccessible population that would have been less likely to pursue vaccination.  \\n\\n### Locating Unvaccinated People for Targeted Outreach  \\n\\nThat brings us to where we are today: a significant proportion of Americans still need a COVID-19 vaccine, but existing data cannot pinpoint who they are or where they are because the data are not centralized, accessible, or detailed at the local level. Most states do not record vaccination data for people within their borders who have been vaccinated at federally-operated FEMA sites or who have received shots in other states.  \\n\\nPoliticians have been tasked with protecting their citizens and getting vaccinations to everyone who needs one, but they are not equipped with the complete datasets they desperately need to make critical decisions on continued vaccine distribution. As of now, local leaders can only design targeted outreach strategies by guessing where hotspots of unvaccinated citizens exist through comparisons of incomplete demographic data on people vaccinated with census-level population data. Mobile vaccine units, if available, could be deployed to fully vaccinate portions of counties since no data identifying the unvaccinated exists. It\u2019s no better than throwing a dart at a map of their regions to find unvaccinated citizens.  \\n\\n### Where do we go now?  \\n\\nWhile these improvements have not been adopted so far, there is still hope. We do not have access to the data required to finally end this pandemic, and even if we could access it, many questions remain. Can we access granular data without infringing on personal privacy? Can data help the U.S. push towards a goal of 100% vaccination and get our lives back to normal? Can we use the knowledge from our vaccine distribution failures and successes to help international vaccination efforts?  \\n\\nWe will address these questions and more as the Pandemic Data Initiative continues to highlight public health data concerns that have been exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Check back later this week for an interview with Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center vaccination expert, Dr. William Moss, where we will discuss vaccination data issues in more detail.  \\n\\n---  \\n \\nReferences:  \\n1.

A Johns Hopkins University-University of Washington Symposium\\n\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected every segment of society, including unique and widespread harms to children such as the closure of schools and the loss of nearly all group activities. This has resulted in broad social, educational, developmental, mental health, safety, and nutritional issues, some of which have been particularly severe for ethnic and racial minority children, as well as those who are low income or have disabilities. And while morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 have been significantly less common for young people than adults, it can be a serious and life-threatening disease in children that may lead to lasting health consequences.  \\n\\nDespite all of this, children and adolescents have not been at the center of COVID-19 immunization efforts or discussions. Only one vaccine has received emergency use authorization for those ages 12 to 15, and while two vaccine trials are underway for those ages 5 to 11, an array of regulatory issues may significantly slow these studies and the eventual rollout of COVID-19 vaccines for children. The risk-benefit ratio may differ by age group in infants, children, and adolescents, and may vary with different products and safety profiles.  \\n\\nThe quest to overcome COVID-19 is further complicated by global vaccine scarcity and the resulting need to use products of lower or less well-studied efficacy outside the U.S. and a small number of other high-income countries. The ethical and epidemiological imperative to expand global vaccine coverage is seen, by some, as an argument not to use efficacious vaccines on lower risk populations, including youth.  \\n\\nAgainst this backdrop, Johns Hopkins University and the University of Washington are hosting their second symposium, convening clinical, scientific, regulatory, and private sector leaders to discuss the effect of COVID-19 on youth and the role pediatric vaccines may play in the COVID-19 response. \u201cCOVID-19 and Kids:  Impacts, Uncertainties and the Role of Vaccines\u201d will highlight COVID-19\u2019s effect on school-age children, particularly those in the 5- to 12-year-old range, and discuss the biological and social strategies that can support youth in the collective fight against COVID-19.  The first symposium in this series, \u201cPreserving the Scientific Integrity of Getting to COVID-19 Vaccines: From Clinical Trials to Public Allocation,\u201d took place in October 2020, and can be viewed [here](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/live/events/covid-19-vaccine-symposium/jhu-uw-vaccine-symposium).  \\n\\n[Register now](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/covid-19-and-kids-impacts-uncertainties-and-the-role-of-vaccines-tickets-158163897475) to better understand COVID-19\u2019s broad effects on kids and the pharmaceutical and social strategies that can support children, adolescents and families.  \\n\\nThis virtual symposium will focus on several key areas:  \\n- COVID-19\u2019s broad effect on youths in the 5- to 12-year-old range and their families  \\n- The current state of play in youth vaccine development  \\n- Ethical aspects of global vaccine scarcity and youth immunization  \\n\\n---  \\n\\n### 1:30 PM: Welcome & Opening Conversation  \\n- Dr. Ellen J.\u202fMacKenzie, PhD,\u202fScM, Dean, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health  \\n- Dr. Hilary Godwin, PhD, Dean, University of Washington School of Public Health  \\n- Dr. Chris\u202fBeyrer,\u202fMD, MPH, Desmond M.

Cooper, Bloomberg Distinguished Professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Equity","subtitle":"","content":"### For most public health challenges, do we have data with key demographic characteristics like age, sex, and race?\\nYes. We have data that documents how most public health challenges affect different groups in our society. For example, we know that rates of conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, and cancer increase with age. We know that conditions such as depression and obesity are more common among women than among men. An extensive amount of data shows disparities in health by race, ethnicity, and social class, across the lifespan. Every year, thousands of African American, American Indian, and Latino babies are born into poverty and other adverse circumstances, putting them at risk for obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and asthma. Adolescents and young adults from disadvantaged backgrounds, compared to more affluent and educated peers, struggle much more with health problems including obesity, asthma, neurocognitive disorders, and mental health diagnoses. Across adulthood, African Americans are more likely to die from all causes than their white counterparts. They suffer from higher rates, at younger ages, of high blood pressure, heart disease, kidney disease, and colon cancer than white Americans. Latinx communities and Native Americans suffer from higher rates of obesity and diabetes than whites. In old age, millions of older African Americans, Native Americans, and Latinx Americans suffer more than do older whites from disease and disability. These health disparities are \u201c[preventable differences in the burden of disease, injury, violence, or in opportunities to achieve optimal health that are experienced by socially disadvantaged populations.](https://www.cdc.gov/aging/disparities/index.htm)\u201d\\n\\n### Why is it important to have this type of demographic data?\\nIt is important to have this type of demographic data because health disparities are avoidable. Health and public health professionals, administrators, employers, policymakers, and even community advocates can use these data to determine how best to use the vast resources we have in this country to improve the lives of our people. We can use the data to help us better understand who is at risk for poor health. It can help us determine which factors \u2013 at the level of individuals, families, neighborhoods, organizations (including health care), communities, and local, regional, and national policies \u2013 could be contributing to poor health across our country, and how we might intervene on all of these levels to remove barriers and enhance the facilitators of good health for everyone in our society. Health equity is \u201cwhen every person has the opportunity to \u2018[attain his or her full health potential](http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/74737/E89383.pdf)\u2019 and no one is \u2018disadvantaged from achieving this potential because of social position or other socially determined circumstances.\u2019\u201d\\n\\n### What do we know about the COVID-19 pandemic from the limited race data that have been released?\\nAs more data about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic becomes available, it is increasingly clear that the disease is hitting the most vulnerable and disadvantaged populations in the U.S. the hardest. Although racial and ethnic information is currently available for only about 35% of the total deaths in the U.S., even this limited sample shows that Black Americans and other historically disadvantaged groups are experiencing infection and death rates that are disproportionately high for their share of the total population. For example, while Black Americans represent only about 13% of the population in the states reporting racial/ethnic information, they account for about 34% of total COVID-19 deaths in those states. Asian Americans and Latinx Americans also show elevated impacts in some regions.\\n\\n### What might account for the racial disparities that we\u2019re seeing?\\nThere are likely multiple causes for these disparities. Existing racial disparities in the rates of chronic medical conditions\\nincrease the risk among ethnic minorities for serious complications of the novel coronavirus and resulting higher death rates. Additionally, the observed disparities in how the disease affects racial/ethnic minority populations highlight inequities in socio-economic status, living conditions, and access to care in the U.S. Because many racial and ethnic minority persons live in poverty, they are experiencing this pandemic in a different way. For example, they may rely on public transit if they cannot afford a car, need to shop more frequently for basic necessities since they cannot afford to stockpile goods, and do not have health insurance or access to regular medical care. Social distancing may not be a convenient or realistic option for many, because they may live in small, multi-family apartments or homes.\\n\\nEthnic minorities are also more likely to be exposed to infection while working, due to their overrepresentation in essential jobs in transportation, government, health care, and food supply services, and in low wage or temporary jobs that may not allow telework or provide paid sick leave.\\n\\nLanguage or educational barriers may prevent some people from understanding best practices to stay safe during the pandemic. They may lack access to high-speed internet and telephone services, placing them at greater risk for being uninformed, and at further risk of reduced access to health care now that much of that care relies on technology for virtual visits. Due to historical and current experiences of discrimination and stigma, distrust in institutions may lead ethnic minorities to subscribe to conspiracy theories and disregard public health guidance from authorities, which puts their communities at greater risk in this pandemic.\\n\\n### How would access to race data influence the development and implementation of the pandemic response?\\nThis data could help local, state, and national policymakers identify which populations may need additional access to resources such as testing, personal protective equipment, education, and support to implement recommended social distancing practices. Such support could include providing access to dormitories or hotel rooms for persons who don\u2019t have a place to self-quarantine or for those who need somewhere to stay if others in their environment become ill. It could include enhancing the support of food pantries and meal delivery services or waivers of restrictions on food assistance. Officials could also fund childcare services, food, and educational resources for children whose parents are unable to provide these due to the economic hardship resulting from the pandemic. Meaningful actions to support these communities and protect public health could also include protective policies for workers, including paid sick leave and provision of health insurance, Medicaid expansions, and extending the enrollment periods for health insurance exchanges. Policymakers should also work to make sure relief funds are available to the communities most in need by streamlining application processes and allowing for extensions of subsidies when the crisis begins to subside.","media":[]}],"verticals":[]},{"id":8,"slug":"maps-and-trends","meta":{"path":"/data","title":"Tracking","description":"Follow global cases and trends.

The map will \u201czoom to\u201d that county and highlight the county border. Click on the county to open a pop-up that contains the county confirmed cases and deaths total. Click on the Infographic Details image to pull up a county dashboard, on which you will find county confirmed cases and deaths, county new cases since the previous day, cumulative state information, and other significant baseline data points\u2014such as typically available hospital beds, at-risk population percentages, and poverty levels. \\n\\n### How is testing positivity calculated in the graphs and charts in the Testing section of the Coronavirus Resource Center?\\n\\n**Positivity Rates:** Our calculation, which is applied consistently across the site and predates most state\'s test positivity tracking efforts, looks at number of cases divided by number of negative tests plus number of cases. We feel that the ideal way to calculate positivity would be number of people who test positive divided by number of people who are tested. We feel this is currently the best way to track positivity because some states include in their testing totals duplicative tests obtained in succession on the same individual, as well as unrelated antibody tests. However, many states are unable to track number of people tested, so they only track number of tests. Because states do not all publish number of positive and number of negative tests per day, we have no choice but to calculate positivity via our approach. \\n\\n**7-Day Averages:** The CRC calculates the rolling 7-day average separately for daily cases and daily tests, and then for each day calculate the percentage over the rolling averages. Some states may be calculating the positivity percentage for each day, and then doing the rolling 7-day average. The reason why we use our approach is because testing capacity issues and uneven reporting cadences create a lot of misleading peaks and valleys in the data. Since we want to give a 7-day average, it is more fair to average the raw data and then calculate the ratios. Otherwise, days when a large number of negative tests are released all at once\u2014and positivity is going to be very low\u2014will have the same weight as days when data was steadily released, and the overall result is going to be lower. Our approach is applied to all our testing data to correct for these uneven data release patterns.\\n\\n### Why does New York City\u2019s data look different on the U.S. Map than on the Global Map?\\n\\nThere are several reasons the data looks different.\\n- When New York started reporting COVID19 cases and deaths, the five boroughs were aggregated under \u201cNew York City.\u201d To maintain consistency, the Global Map continues to group the data. However, the U.S. Map is able to break the data into the boroughs\u2019 respective counties.\\n- The New York City daily reports break out Confirmed deaths by county, but does not break out Probable deaths by county. As a result, the U.S. Map is not able to include Probable deaths by county, but the Global Map is able to include Probable deaths since it groups the data.\\n- There are Confirmed Cases and Deaths that have no county association, and are reported under \u2018Unknown.\u2019 As a result, they cannot be included in the county data.\\n\\n### There are other counties where the data does not look the way I expect. Why is that?\\n- **Dukes and Nantucket Counties, Massachusetts:** The state reports confirmed cases by county, but aggregates deaths for these two counties together. \\n- **Rhode Island:** Currently, Rhode Island reports confirmed cases by county, but only reports deaths at the state level. This means that we are unable to report out on deaths at the county level. You will find the Rhode Island count of deaths are grouped under \'Unassigned.\'\\n- **Utah:** Utah is reporting county data somewhat differently than many other states. The larger-population counties are reporting confirmed cases and deaths at the county level. However, the smaller counties are banded together into county groups. This is in an effort to protect identities of individuals.\\n\\n### Can the dashboard\u2019s data be used by my business or government agency?\\n\\nIf you are a government agency, you may use the data for your purposes provided credit is attributed to the Johns Hopkins University.

Members of the media with questions should contact the Johns Hopkins University Office of Communications at 443-997-9009 or at\u202f[jhunews@jhu.edu](mailto:jhunews@jhu.edu). \\n\\n### Why does the U.S. Map provide a view of Tribal Nations?\\n\\nAmerican Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) communities are experiencing some of the highest rates of COVID-19 in the country. There are, however, substantial gaps in the availability of COVID-19 data from Tribal communities in publicly available data sources and data displays. This map is designed to begin to address those data gaps and improve visualization of cases occurring in AIAN settings. \\n\\nDeveloped in collaboration with Center for American Indian Health, this map identifies counties in the U.S. that intersect with federally recognized Native land reservations and displays the most up-to-date COVID data that are available for those counties. This depiction of data will not be a perfect representation of COVID-19 burden in specific Tribal communities where borders do not align directly with county lines. Our intention in presenting data this way is to bring attention to the unequal burden of COVID-19 in AIAN settings while also respecting Tribal sovereignty and individual privacy. For the most accurate data on COVID rates in a given community, we recommend contacting Tribal, regional, or Urban Indian health program representatives in the community of interest.  \\n\\nThis map has been adapted from two sources: the Indian Health Service (continental United States) and Esri (Alaska Native Village lands). It is not a perfect or inclusive representation of all land boundaries for American Indians or Alaska Natives and is limited to federally recognized Tribal nations in the continental U.S. and Alaska Village lands \u2013 this map does not include Urban Indian populations though we recognize that there is also a need to represent Urban Indian data. Please note that there may be Native communities not represented in this visualization, and that this map does not include any individuals living outside of the counties that intersect with these land boundaries who may identify as AIAN. This map is not meant to serve as a complete representation of COVID data for all AIAN individuals in the United States. Finally, this map does not represent or intend to represent official or legal boundaries of any Indigenous communities. \\n\\nFor information on definitive land boundaries, please contact the specific tribal nation or Urban Indian community in question. If you see an error in this map, please contact [Covid19map@jhu.edu](mailto:Covid19map@jhu.edu).

In this way, vaccines mimic natural infection but without actually causing the person to become sick.  \\n\\nFor SARS-CoV-2, antibodies that bind to and block the spike protein on the virus\u2019s surface are thought to be most important for protection from disease because the spike protein is what attaches to human cells, allowing the virus to enter our cells. Blocking this entrance prevents infection.  \\n\\nNot all people who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop disease (Covid-19 is the disease caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2). These people have asymptomatic infection but can still transmit the virus to others.  \\n\\nIn general, most vaccines do not completely prevent infection but do prevent the infection from spreading within the body and from causing disease. Many vaccines can also prevent transmission, potentially leading to herd protection whereby unvaccinated people are protected from infection by the vaccinated people around them because they have less chance of exposure to the virus. We are still learning whether or not the current Covid-19 vaccines prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2. It is likely they reduce the risk of virus transmission but probably not completely in everyone. This is one of the reasons why it will still be important for people to continue wearing masks and practicing physical distancing, even after being vaccinated.  \\n\\n## How do we know if a vaccine is safe and effective?  \\n\\nThe safety and efficacy of a vaccine are determined through clinical trials. Clinical trials are studies that are typically conducted in three phases to assess the safety and efficacy of vaccines in increasingly larger numbers of volunteers.  \\n\\nPhase 1 clinical trials assess the safety and dosage of a vaccine in a small number of people, typically a dozen to several dozen healthy volunteers. Whether a vaccine stimulates immune responses is often assessed in a phase 1 study but this is better assessed in phase 2 studies, which typically involve hundreds of people including some special groups such as children, people with pre-existing conditions such as heart disease, and older adults. Vaccine safety is also assessed in phase 2 studies, in which adverse events not detected in phase 1 trials may be identified because a larger and more diverse group of people receive the vaccine. However, only in much larger phase 3 clinical trials can it be demonstrated whether a vaccine is actually protective against disease and safety is more fully assessed.  \\n\\nPhase 3 clinical trials often include thousands of volunteers, and for Covid-19 vaccines involve tens of thousands (30,000 to 45,000 people in some of the phase 3 trials). In phase 3 trials, participants are randomized to receive either the viral vaccine or a placebo vaccine (sometimes a vaccine against another disease or a harmless substance like saline). Randomization is a process to determine who receives the vaccine and who receives the placebo without any bias, like flipping a coin. To further prevent any bias in interpreting the study data, participants and most of the investigators will not know if an individual received the vaccine or placebo. The participants are then followed to see how many in each group get the disease. If the vaccine is efficacious, many fewer people who received the viral vaccine will get the disease compared to those who received the placebo vaccine. It takes time for cases of disease to accumulate so that we can be confident there is a true difference between the two groups, and this is why these phase 3 trials often take time. Another major goal of phase 3 trials is assessing safety, both short-term (e.g., fever, tenderness, muscle aches) and long-term (e.g., autoimmune conditions or enhanced disease following infection).  \\n\\nAfter a vaccine is approved and in more widespread use, it is critically important to continue to monitor for both safety and effectiveness. Some very rare side effects may only be detectable when large numbers of people have been vaccinated. Safety concerns that are discovered at this late stage could lead a licensed vaccine to be withdrawn from use, although this is very rare. The rare allergic (anaphylactic) reactions seen with the mRNA Covid-19 vaccines were not identified in the phase 3 trials but only after more widespread use.  \\n\\n## What are the side effects of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA Covid-19 vaccines?  \\n\\nThe best information on the side effects of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines comes from the large phase 3 trials that served as the basis for the Emergency Use Authorizations. The most common side effects of both vaccines are what is called reactogenicity. These are expected side effects and caused by local inflammation (redness and swelling) at the site of injection or more generalized reactions such as fever and muscle aches. For both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, these reactogenic side effects were mild to moderate, occurred up to two days after vaccination, and do not have any long-term consequences. For the Pfizer mRNA vaccine, the most common side effects were soreness or redness at the site of injection (84% of vaccine recipients), fatigue (63%), headache (55%), muscle pain (38%), chills (32%), joint pain (24%), and fever (14%). Side effects following receipt of the Moderna mRNA vaccine were similar but with slightly different frequencies. The most common side effects were soreness or redness at the site of injection (92%), fatigue (69%), headache (63%), muscle pain (60%), joint pain (45%), and chills (43%).  \\n\\nMore severe allergic reactions have occurred more rarely in some people immediately following receipt of one of the mRNA vaccines. In a recent analysis conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 10 cases of anaphylaxis were reported after administration of 4,041,396 first doses of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine between December 21, 2020 and January 10, 2021. This was an incidence of 2.5 cases of severe allergic reactions per one million doses administered. For this reason, the mRNA vaccines should only be administered in a setting capable of managing and treating anaphylactic reactions. We still do not know the exact cause of these reactions but some think it may be a reaction to the fatty coat that surrounds and protects the mRNA in the vaccine, specifically polyethylene glycol, a compound found in many products including skin creams and toothpaste and that has been associated with allergic reactions. People who have an immediate allergic reaction to the first vaccine dose should not receive additional doses of either mRNA Covid-19 vaccine.  \\n\\n## Will I be protected after just one dose?  \\n\\nWhile some protection may be conferred after a single dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines, this protection is far less than after two doses. The second dose acts as a booster, better preparing the immune system to fight infection. All people should receive two doses of these vaccines.  \\n\\n## Can I wait longer than recommended to get my second dose?  \\n\\nThe scientific data from the large phase 3 trials of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines demonstrated high protective efficacy when the second dose was administered at a precise interval following the first dose: 21 days for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and 28 days for the Moderna vaccine. For this reason, the second Covid-19 vaccine dose should be administered as close to the recommended interval as possible. However, current challenges with vaccine availability may make this not possible. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines may be administered up to 6 weeks (42 days) after the first dose when it is not possible to adhere to the standard schedule but notes that there are limited data on the efficacy of mRNA vaccines administered beyond this time.  \\n\\n## Can I receive different vaccine types?  \\n\\nAgain, the scientific data from the large phase 3 trials of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines demonstrated high protective efficacy when the second dose was the same vaccine as the first dose. These vaccines are not interchangeable and the safety and efficacy of combinations of vaccines have not been evaluated. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently stated that, in exceptional situations in which the first-dose vaccine product cannot be determined or is no longer available, any available mRNA Covid-19 vaccine may be administered to complete the mRNA Covid-19 vaccination series.  \\n\\n## Do I still need to wear a mask and practice physical distancing after I am vaccinated?  \\n\\nYes. Until we substantially reduce community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and see hospitalizations and deaths dramatically decrease, we still need to wear masks and practice physical distancing even after vaccination. The vaccine is not 100% effective and we still do not know if someone who was vaccinated can develop asymptomatic infection and transmit the virus. Although the phase 3 clinical trials were designed to determine whether vaccinated individuals are protected against disease, it will also be important to understand whether vaccinated individuals are less likely to transmit the virus. This is likely but not ensured. If a vaccine not only protects against disease but reduces transmission, and continues to do so for many years, we are likely to reach a state of herd protection when masks and physical distancing will no longer be required. Herd protection is achieved when a sufficient proportion of the population is made non-infectious through vaccination or natural infection so that the likelihood of an infectious individual transmitting to a susceptible individual is very low.  \\n\\n## Will the current Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines protect against the new variants?  \\n\\nAll viruses mutate over time but several variants of SARS-CoV-2 with multiple mutations, particularly in the gene that encodes for the spike protein, have been identified that have become more prevalent, including variants from the United Kingdom, South Africa, and Brazil. The best evidence of whether the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines provide less protection against these variants will be if we identify people who become infected with one of the variants after receiving two vaccine doses. Before that, we can learn from studies in the laboratory. Recent studies suggest that both vaccines are effective against these variants but may be slightly less protective against the South African variant. However, much remains to be learned. Both vaccine manufactures are working on modified vaccines to better protect against the South African SARS-CoV-2 variant.  \\n\\n## How long will it take for vaccines to be available to everyone?  \\n\\nIt is not clear at this point in time when vaccines will be available to everyone, but a reasonable guess may be by the end of the summer or early fall of this year. The timeline depends on how rapidly vaccine doses can be produced and distributed. Importantly, the public will need to trust a vaccine and be willing to be vaccinated to have a public health impact. Building trust in a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, particularly in communities with long-standing mistrust of the government and scientific experiments, is critical.  \\n\\n## Can pregnant women be vaccinated?  \\n\\nAlthough the large phase 3 trials of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines did not include pregnant women, eligible pregnant women may be vaccinated. The two mRNA vaccines are not contraindicated during pregnancy. Pregnant women should consider the risks of Covid-19, which may be more severe in pregnant women, and the uncertain risk of vaccination. More information on the safety and efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines in pregnant women will become available over time.  \\n\\n## When can children get the vaccine?  \\n\\nWhile children are less likely to develop severe disease and die from Covid-19, there are several reasons for ensuring that eventually there is a vaccine that is safe and effective for children. Although rare, some children may develop severe disease or die from Covid-19. Children have also developed a severe inflammatory syndrome, called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Children may be important transmitters of SARS-CoV-2 and vaccinating them with a vaccine that reduces transmission could be important in controlling the pandemic. Finally, having a safe vaccine for children will build confidence towards opening up schools and learning centers for in-person educational processes.  \\n\\nBoth the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are being studied in children as young as 12 years of age. These studies typically involve several thousand children, and not the tens of thousands studied in phase 3 trials in adults. Assuming the vaccines are safe and effective, the vaccines will be studied in younger and younger children. Studies of the Moderna vaccine in children 1 to 11 years of age may start soon.  \\n\\n## How long will protection last following vaccination?  \\n\\nWe do not yet know how long protection lasts following vaccination but it will be critically important to measure long-term protection (at least two years) in the phase 3 trials and by following people who have been vaccinated outside of the trials. We are still learning about the duration of protection following infection with SARS-CoV-2 and it is too early to tell how long protection will last. There have already been cases where individuals have been shown to be infected twice but most often the second illness was mild or without any symptoms. This is what we would expect with an immune response that protects against disease but not infection.  \\n\\n## If I already had Covid-19, should I still get a vaccine?  \\n\\nYes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people who have had Covid-19 should still be vaccinated because of the severe health risks associated with Covid-19 and the fact that reinfection is possible. People who were treated for Covid-19 with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma should wait 90 days before getting a Covid-19 vaccine.  \\n\\n## Can someone get Covid-19 from the vaccine?  \\n\\nNo, it is not possible to get Covid-19 from vaccines. Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 use inactivated virus, parts of the virus (e.g., the spike protein), or a gene from the virus. None of these can cause Covid-19.  \\n\\n## Should I get the vaccine for influenza (flu shot)?  \\n\\nYes, it is very important to get the influenza vaccine, particularly this season when both influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2 can infect people. We still do not know how these two viruses will interact but people can get infected with both viruses and this will likely cause more severe disease and possibly death. Reducing the number of people who get severe influenza and require hospitalization will also help ensure that the health care system, hospitals and intensive care units will not be overwhelmed should there be an increase in Covid-19 cases this fall and winter.  \\n\\n## What are the different types of vaccines in use or in development and why are there so many?  \\nSeveral different types of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease Covid-19, are in use or in development. Many manufacturers around the world are working on this global problem. This means that there will continue to be different types of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and they may work differently in different people. Some are based on traditional methods for producing vaccines and others on newer methods. \\n\\nBoth of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that have received Emergency Use Authorization in the United States, manufactured by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, use one of the most novel approaches: The gene for the spike protein can be used directly as a vaccine in the form of DNA or messenger RNA (mRNA).  \\n\\nOne of the more traditional ways of making a viral vaccine is to inactivate (kill) the virus with chemicals, such as is done with the flu vaccine, inactivated polio or hepatitis A vaccines, so that the virus can no longer multiply. Several inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are in use, such as those produced by the Chinese vaccine manufacturers Sinopharm and Sinovac Biotech, and others are in development. Other vaccines are based on just a part of the bacteria or virus, typically one or more proteins, such as the vaccines for whooping cough (pertussis) and hepatitis B virus. For SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that focus on a part of the virus, this means the spike protein on the surface of the virus. A protein-based vaccine produced by Novavax is being studied in a large trial in the United States.  \\n\\nNewer vaccine types include what are called viral vector vaccines, in which the SARS-CoV-2 gene for the spike protein is inserted into another harmless virus to deliver the gene to human cells where the spike protein is produced. The spike protein then stimulates immune responses. The most common viral vectors are adenoviruses, which typically cause common cold-like symptoms in people but are further weakened for vaccines so they cannot cause any disease at all. The adenovirus vector vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, developed and produced by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca, is in use in several countries, including Britain, India, Brazil, and Mexico. Other adenovirus vector vaccines are in advanced clinical testing (phase 3 clinical trials), such as the vaccine produced by Johnson & Johnson that may be protective following a single dose.  \\n\\n## What is an emergency use authorization?  \\n\\nDrugs and vaccines have to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ensure that only safe and effective products are available to the American public. In situations when there is good scientific reason to believe that a drug is safe and is likely to treat or prevent disease, the FDA may authorize its use even if definitive proof of the efficacy of the drug is not known, especially for diseases that cause high mortality. On December 11, 2020 the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid\u201019 Vaccine and on December 18, 2020 the FDA issued an EUA for the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine. We expect that the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines will receive full approval, called a Biologics License Application, in the first half of 2021.  \\n\\nThe bar for ensuring safety of a vaccine is higher than for a therapeutic to treat an ill person. Vaccines are given to potentially millions of healthy people, unlike drugs for sick people, and loss of trust in a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 could spill over into loss of trust in other vaccines, seriously jeopardizing public health.  \\n\\n## How did the process for approving Covid-19 vaccines move so quickly?  \\n\\nTraditionally, it has taken many years to develop a vaccine, confirm its safety and efficacy, and manufacture the vaccine in sufficient quantities for public use. This timeline has been substantially shortened for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. There are several ways this has been made possible. First, some clinical trials have combined phases 1 and 2 to assess safety and immune responses. Second, because of the high number of new cases of Covid-19 in many places, differences in disease risk between those who received the viral vaccine and those who received the placebo or comparison vaccine can be measured more quickly than in the absence of a pandemic. Third, the United States government and others heavily invested in building the manufacturing capacity to produce large numbers of vaccine doses before the findings of the phase 3 trials were available. Typically, vaccine manufacturers wait until the phase 3 trial is completed and shows safety and efficacy before making such a large investment in manufacturing capacity. None of these factors that contribute to the accelerated development of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 imply that safety, scientific or ethical integrity are compromised, or that short-cuts were made.\\n","media":[]}],"verticals":[]},{"id":48,"slug":"vaccine-research-and-development","meta":{"path":"/vaccines/timeline","title":"Vaccine Research & Development","description":"How can COVID-19 vaccine development be done quickly and safely?","image":"/images/assets/vaccine-timeline-thumbnail_d9f7cb546c.png"},"section":"","title":"Vaccine Research & Development","subtitle":"How can COVID-19 vaccine development be done quickly and safely?","caption":null,"content_blocks":[],"verticals":["vaccines"]},{"id":27,"slug":"testing-per-100k","meta":{"path":"/testing/international-comparison","title":"How Does Testing in the U.S. Compare to Other Countries?","description":"The U.S. has conducted more COVID-19 tests than any other country.

When states report the number of COVID-19 tests performed, this should include the number of viral tests performed and the number of patients for which these tests were performed. Currently, states may not be distinguishing overall tests administered from the number of individuals who have been tested. This is an important limitation to the data that is available to track testing in the U.S., and states should work to address it.\\n \\nWhen states report testing numbers for COVID-19 infection, they should not include serology or antibody tests.

States that include serology tests within their overall COVID-19 testing numbers are misrepresenting their testing capacity and the extent to which they are working to identify COVID-19 infections within their communities. States that wish to track the number of serology tests being performed should report those numbers separately from viral tests performed to diagnose COVID-19.\\n\\n[Learn more about why the positivity rates shown on our site may differ from state calculations](/testing/differences-in-positivity-rates)","media":[]},{"id":30,"slug":"testing-positivity-page-visual","title":"Testing positivity page visual","subtitle":null,"content":"","media":[]},{"id":61,"slug":"postitivity-sidebar-explainer","title":"postitivity-sidebar-explainer","subtitle":null,"content":"[Click here to learn more about why the positivity rates shown on our site may differ from state calculations](/testing/differences-in-positivity-rates)  \\n\\n**7-Day Averages: ** The CRC calculates the rolling 7-day average separately for daily cases and daily tests, and then for each day calculate the percentage over the rolling averages.

In this way, vaccines mimic natural infection but without actually causing the person to become sick.  \\n\\nFor SARS-CoV-2, antibodies that bind to and block the spike protein on the virus\u2019s surface are thought to be most important for protection from disease because the spike protein is what attaches to human cells, allowing the virus to enter our cells. Blocking this entrance prevents infection.  \\n\\nNot all people who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop disease (Covid-19 is the disease caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2). These people have asymptomatic infection but can still transmit the virus to others.  \\n\\nIn general, most vaccines do not completely prevent infection but do prevent the infection from spreading within the body and from causing disease. Many vaccines can also prevent transmission, potentially leading to herd protection whereby unvaccinated people are protected from infection by the vaccinated people around them because they have less chance of exposure to the virus. We are still learning whether or not the current Covid-19 vaccines prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2. It is likely they reduce the risk of virus transmission but probably not completely in everyone. This is one of the reasons why it will still be important for people to continue wearing masks and practicing physical distancing, even after being vaccinated.  \\n\\n## How do we know if a vaccine is safe and effective?  \\n\\nThe safety and efficacy of a vaccine are determined through clinical trials. Clinical trials are studies that are typically conducted in three phases to assess the safety and efficacy of vaccines in increasingly larger numbers of volunteers.  \\n\\nPhase 1 clinical trials assess the safety and dosage of a vaccine in a small number of people, typically a dozen to several dozen healthy volunteers. Whether a vaccine stimulates immune responses is often assessed in a phase 1 study but this is better assessed in phase 2 studies, which typically involve hundreds of people including some special groups such as children, people with pre-existing conditions such as heart disease, and older adults. Vaccine safety is also assessed in phase 2 studies, in which adverse events not detected in phase 1 trials may be identified because a larger and more diverse group of people receive the vaccine. However, only in much larger phase 3 clinical trials can it be demonstrated whether a vaccine is actually protective against disease and safety is more fully assessed.  \\n\\nPhase 3 clinical trials often include thousands of volunteers, and for Covid-19 vaccines involve tens of thousands (30,000 to 45,000 people in some of the phase 3 trials). In phase 3 trials, participants are randomized to receive either the viral vaccine or a placebo vaccine (sometimes a vaccine against another disease or a harmless substance like saline). Randomization is a process to determine who receives the vaccine and who receives the placebo without any bias, like flipping a coin. To further prevent any bias in interpreting the study data, participants and most of the investigators will not know if an individual received the vaccine or placebo. The participants are then followed to see how many in each group get the disease. If the vaccine is efficacious, many fewer people who received the viral vaccine will get the disease compared to those who received the placebo vaccine. It takes time for cases of disease to accumulate so that we can be confident there is a true difference between the two groups, and this is why these phase 3 trials often take time. Another major goal of phase 3 trials is assessing safety, both short-term (e.g., fever, tenderness, muscle aches) and long-term (e.g., autoimmune conditions or enhanced disease following infection).  \\n\\nAfter a vaccine is approved and in more widespread use, it is critically important to continue to monitor for both safety and effectiveness. Some very rare side effects may only be detectable when large numbers of people have been vaccinated. Safety concerns that are discovered at this late stage could lead a licensed vaccine to be withdrawn from use, although this is very rare. The rare allergic (anaphylactic) reactions seen with the mRNA Covid-19 vaccines were not identified in the phase 3 trials but only after more widespread use.  \\n\\n## What are the side effects of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA Covid-19 vaccines?  \\n\\nThe best information on the side effects of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines comes from the large phase 3 trials that served as the basis for the Emergency Use Authorizations. The most common side effects of both vaccines are what is called reactogenicity. These are expected side effects and caused by local inflammation (redness and swelling) at the site of injection or more generalized reactions such as fever and muscle aches. For both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, these reactogenic side effects were mild to moderate, occurred up to two days after vaccination, and do not have any long-term consequences. For the Pfizer mRNA vaccine, the most common side effects were soreness or redness at the site of injection (84% of vaccine recipients), fatigue (63%), headache (55%), muscle pain (38%), chills (32%), joint pain (24%), and fever (14%). Side effects following receipt of the Moderna mRNA vaccine were similar but with slightly different frequencies. The most common side effects were soreness or redness at the site of injection (92%), fatigue (69%), headache (63%), muscle pain (60%), joint pain (45%), and chills (43%).  \\n\\nMore severe allergic reactions have occurred more rarely in some people immediately following receipt of one of the mRNA vaccines. In a recent analysis conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 10 cases of anaphylaxis were reported after administration of 4,041,396 first doses of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine between December 21, 2020 and January 10, 2021. This was an incidence of 2.5 cases of severe allergic reactions per one million doses administered. For this reason, the mRNA vaccines should only be administered in a setting capable of managing and treating anaphylactic reactions. We still do not know the exact cause of these reactions but some think it may be a reaction to the fatty coat that surrounds and protects the mRNA in the vaccine, specifically polyethylene glycol, a compound found in many products including skin creams and toothpaste and that has been associated with allergic reactions. People who have an immediate allergic reaction to the first vaccine dose should not receive additional doses of either mRNA Covid-19 vaccine.  \\n\\n## Will I be protected after just one dose?  \\n\\nWhile some protection may be conferred after a single dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines, this protection is far less than after two doses. The second dose acts as a booster, better preparing the immune system to fight infection. All people should receive two doses of these vaccines.  \\n\\n## Can I wait longer than recommended to get my second dose?  \\n\\nThe scientific data from the large phase 3 trials of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines demonstrated high protective efficacy when the second dose was administered at a precise interval following the first dose: 21 days for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and 28 days for the Moderna vaccine. For this reason, the second Covid-19 vaccine dose should be administered as close to the recommended interval as possible. However, current challenges with vaccine availability may make this not possible. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines may be administered up to 6 weeks (42 days) after the first dose when it is not possible to adhere to the standard schedule but notes that there are limited data on the efficacy of mRNA vaccines administered beyond this time.  \\n\\n## Can I receive different vaccine types?  \\n\\nAgain, the scientific data from the large phase 3 trials of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines demonstrated high protective efficacy when the second dose was the same vaccine as the first dose. These vaccines are not interchangeable and the safety and efficacy of combinations of vaccines have not been evaluated. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently stated that, in exceptional situations in which the first-dose vaccine product cannot be determined or is no longer available, any available mRNA Covid-19 vaccine may be administered to complete the mRNA Covid-19 vaccination series.  \\n\\n## Do I still need to wear a mask and practice physical distancing after I am vaccinated?  \\n\\nYes. Until we substantially reduce community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and see hospitalizations and deaths dramatically decrease, we still need to wear masks and practice physical distancing even after vaccination. The vaccine is not 100% effective and we still do not know if someone who was vaccinated can develop asymptomatic infection and transmit the virus. Although the phase 3 clinical trials were designed to determine whether vaccinated individuals are protected against disease, it will also be important to understand whether vaccinated individuals are less likely to transmit the virus. This is likely but not ensured. If a vaccine not only protects against disease but reduces transmission, and continues to do so for many years, we are likely to reach a state of herd protection when masks and physical distancing will no longer be required. Herd protection is achieved when a sufficient proportion of the population is made non-infectious through vaccination or natural infection so that the likelihood of an infectious individual transmitting to a susceptible individual is very low.  \\n\\n## Will the current Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines protect against the new variants?  \\n\\nAll viruses mutate over time but several variants of SARS-CoV-2 with multiple mutations, particularly in the gene that encodes for the spike protein, have been identified that have become more prevalent, including variants from the United Kingdom, South Africa, and Brazil. The best evidence of whether the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines provide less protection against these variants will be if we identify people who become infected with one of the variants after receiving two vaccine doses. Before that, we can learn from studies in the laboratory. Recent studies suggest that both vaccines are effective against these variants but may be slightly less protective against the South African variant. However, much remains to be learned. Both vaccine manufactures are working on modified vaccines to better protect against the South African SARS-CoV-2 variant.  \\n\\n## How long will it take for vaccines to be available to everyone?  \\n\\nIt is not clear at this point in time when vaccines will be available to everyone, but a reasonable guess may be by the end of the summer or early fall of this year. The timeline depends on how rapidly vaccine doses can be produced and distributed. Importantly, the public will need to trust a vaccine and be willing to be vaccinated to have a public health impact. Building trust in a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, particularly in communities with long-standing mistrust of the government and scientific experiments, is critical.  \\n\\n## Can pregnant women be vaccinated?  \\n\\nAlthough the large phase 3 trials of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines did not include pregnant women, eligible pregnant women may be vaccinated. The two mRNA vaccines are not contraindicated during pregnancy. Pregnant women should consider the risks of Covid-19, which may be more severe in pregnant women, and the uncertain risk of vaccination. More information on the safety and efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines in pregnant women will become available over time.  \\n\\n## When can children get the vaccine?  \\n\\nWhile children are less likely to develop severe disease and die from Covid-19, there are several reasons for ensuring that eventually there is a vaccine that is safe and effective for children. Although rare, some children may develop severe disease or die from Covid-19. Children have also developed a severe inflammatory syndrome, called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Children may be important transmitters of SARS-CoV-2 and vaccinating them with a vaccine that reduces transmission could be important in controlling the pandemic. Finally, having a safe vaccine for children will build confidence towards opening up schools and learning centers for in-person educational processes.  \\n\\nBoth the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are being studied in children as young as 12 years of age. These studies typically involve several thousand children, and not the tens of thousands studied in phase 3 trials in adults. Assuming the vaccines are safe and effective, the vaccines will be studied in younger and younger children. Studies of the Moderna vaccine in children 1 to 11 years of age may start soon.  \\n\\n## How long will protection last following vaccination?  \\n\\nWe do not yet know how long protection lasts following vaccination but it will be critically important to measure long-term protection (at least two years) in the phase 3 trials and by following people who have been vaccinated outside of the trials. We are still learning about the duration of protection following infection with SARS-CoV-2 and it is too early to tell how long protection will last. There have already been cases where individuals have been shown to be infected twice but most often the second illness was mild or without any symptoms. This is what we would expect with an immune response that protects against disease but not infection.  \\n\\n## If I already had Covid-19, should I still get a vaccine?  \\n\\nYes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people who have had Covid-19 should still be vaccinated because of the severe health risks associated with Covid-19 and the fact that reinfection is possible. People who were treated for Covid-19 with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma should wait 90 days before getting a Covid-19 vaccine.  \\n\\n## Can someone get Covid-19 from the vaccine?  \\n\\nNo, it is not possible to get Covid-19 from vaccines. Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 use inactivated virus, parts of the virus (e.g., the spike protein), or a gene from the virus. None of these can cause Covid-19.  \\n\\n## Should I get the vaccine for influenza (flu shot)?  \\n\\nYes, it is very important to get the influenza vaccine, particularly this season when both influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2 can infect people. We still do not know how these two viruses will interact but people can get infected with both viruses and this will likely cause more severe disease and possibly death. Reducing the number of people who get severe influenza and require hospitalization will also help ensure that the health care system, hospitals and intensive care units will not be overwhelmed should there be an increase in Covid-19 cases this fall and winter.  \\n\\n## What are the different types of vaccines in use or in development and why are there so many?  \\nSeveral different types of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease Covid-19, are in use or in development. Many manufacturers around the world are working on this global problem. This means that there will continue to be different types of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and they may work differently in different people. Some are based on traditional methods for producing vaccines and others on newer methods. \\n\\nBoth of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that have received Emergency Use Authorization in the United States, manufactured by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, use one of the most novel approaches: The gene for the spike protein can be used directly as a vaccine in the form of DNA or messenger RNA (mRNA).  \\n\\nOne of the more traditional ways of making a viral vaccine is to inactivate (kill) the virus with chemicals, such as is done with the flu vaccine, inactivated polio or hepatitis A vaccines, so that the virus can no longer multiply. Several inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are in use, such as those produced by the Chinese vaccine manufacturers Sinopharm and Sinovac Biotech, and others are in development. Other vaccines are based on just a part of the bacteria or virus, typically one or more proteins, such as the vaccines for whooping cough (pertussis) and hepatitis B virus. For SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that focus on a part of the virus, this means the spike protein on the surface of the virus. A protein-based vaccine produced by Novavax is being studied in a large trial in the United States.  \\n\\nNewer vaccine types include what are called viral vector vaccines, in which the SARS-CoV-2 gene for the spike protein is inserted into another harmless virus to deliver the gene to human cells where the spike protein is produced. The spike protein then stimulates immune responses. The most common viral vectors are adenoviruses, which typically cause common cold-like symptoms in people but are further weakened for vaccines so they cannot cause any disease at all. The adenovirus vector vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, developed and produced by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca, is in use in several countries, including Britain, India, Brazil, and Mexico. Other adenovirus vector vaccines are in advanced clinical testing (phase 3 clinical trials), such as the vaccine produced by Johnson & Johnson that may be protective following a single dose.  \\n\\n## What is an emergency use authorization?  \\n\\nDrugs and vaccines have to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ensure that only safe and effective products are available to the American public. In situations when there is good scientific reason to believe that a drug is safe and is likely to treat or prevent disease, the FDA may authorize its use even if definitive proof of the efficacy of the drug is not known, especially for diseases that cause high mortality. On December 11, 2020 the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid\u201019 Vaccine and on December 18, 2020 the FDA issued an EUA for the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine. We expect that the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines will receive full approval, called a Biologics License Application, in the first half of 2021.  \\n\\nThe bar for ensuring safety of a vaccine is higher than for a therapeutic to treat an ill person. Vaccines are given to potentially millions of healthy people, unlike drugs for sick people, and loss of trust in a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 could spill over into loss of trust in other vaccines, seriously jeopardizing public health.  \\n\\n## How did the process for approving Covid-19 vaccines move so quickly?  \\n\\nTraditionally, it has taken many years to develop a vaccine, confirm its safety and efficacy, and manufacture the vaccine in sufficient quantities for public use. This timeline has been substantially shortened for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. There are several ways this has been made possible. First, some clinical trials have combined phases 1 and 2 to assess safety and immune responses. Second, because of the high number of new cases of Covid-19 in many places, differences in disease risk between those who received the viral vaccine and those who received the placebo or comparison vaccine can be measured more quickly than in the absence of a pandemic. Third, the United States government and others heavily invested in building the manufacturing capacity to produce large numbers of vaccine doses before the findings of the phase 3 trials were available. Typically, vaccine manufacturers wait until the phase 3 trial is completed and shows safety and efficacy before making such a large investment in manufacturing capacity. None of these factors that contribute to the accelerated development of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 imply that safety, scientific or ethical integrity are compromised, or that short-cuts were made.\\n","media":[]},{"id":81,"slug":"vaccine-home-covid-19-vaccine-matters","title":"Vaccine Home - COVID-19 VACCINE MATTERS","subtitle":null,"content":"## COVID-19 VACCINE MATTERS\\n\\nCOVID-19 VACCINE MATTERS: A blog series discussing the evolving science and policy of COVID-19 vaccines, led by internationally renowned experts in vaccine development, Dr. Larry Corey of the Univeristy of Washington, and Dr. Chris Beyrer of Johns Hopkins University.","media":[]}],"verticals":[]},{"id":34,"slug":"about","meta":{"path":"/about","title":"About Us","description":"The Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center (CRC) is a continuously updated source of COVID-19 data and expert guidance.

Faced with uncertainty about the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, people are trying to understand and communicate these complex issues to the public. Here we provide key messages to communicate accurate information to the public so individuals can make informed vaccination decisions.*  \\n\\n---  \\n\\n**This adverse event is extremely rare.**  \\nThus far, [6 people who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s0413-JJ-vaccine.html) have experienced the rare blood clotting disorder, out of the nearly 7 million people who have received the vaccine to date. Therefore, the probability of experiencing this rare blood clotting side effect is less than one in a million. That means, among one million people vaccinated, one person may experience this adverse event. In other words, it is a million times more likely this adverse event will ***not*** occur after vaccination. A person is twice as likely to be struck by lightning in a year.  \\n\\n**Use of this vaccine is paused while the CDC and FDA investigate.**  \\nNearly 7 million people have been vaccinated with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine  in the U.S., most with only mild or no side effects. Out of an abundance of caution, use of that vaccine has been \u201cpaused\u201d in the US\u2014that means, while the CDC and FDA are reviewing the six reported blood clotting disorder cases, it is recommended that the vaccine not be administered. This also helps health care providers be aware of the potential for this adverse event.  \\n\\n**CDC and FDA are convening expert committees to review these reports.**  \\n[CDC\u2019s expert advisory committee](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/index.html) will convene this week to review the six cases and other data on the vaccine and provide recommendations. That means determining if these adverse events are actually related to the vaccine or not. The FDA will review the evidence and provide recommendations on how to proceed, including developing updated policies and guidance if needed.  \\n\\n**The benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks.**  \\nWe do not yet know if the [blood clotting disorder](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/cerebral-venous-sinus-thrombosis#:~:text=Cerebral%20venous%20sinus%20thrombosis%20(CVST)%20occurs%20when%20a%20blood%20clot,brain%20tissues%2C%20forming%20a%20hemorrhage) experienced by these 6 individuals is related to the vaccine. We do know that the benefit of the vaccine \u2014 keeping people from being infected with the coronavirus or keeping those few who get COVID-19 out of the hospital \u2014 vastly outweighs the small risk of experiencing the blood clotting disorder. To date, nearly seven million people in the United States have received Johnson & Johnson shots\u2014the vast majority have had no or mild side effects. \\n\\n**Safety monitoring systems are doing their job.**  \\nIt is common for regulators to investigate \u201csafety signals\u201d in medical products, including new vaccines. Very often, the signals prove not to be of concern. A vaccine safety signal is information that indicates that there could be a potential link between a vaccine and an event previously unknown or incompletely documented. The signal will suggest a new potentially causal association (or a new aspect of a known association) between a vaccine and an event, which could be either adverse or beneficial. It\u2019s important to be responsive to any safety concern. In the US, the FDA and CDC have [many systems](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vaers/index.html) in place to find, report, and investigate any adverse events\u2014even those that could turn out to be unrelated to the vaccines.\\n\\n**If you experience an adverse event, report it.**  \\nIf someone that received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine 1 to 3 weeks ago is experiencing severe headaches, abdominal pain, difficulty breathing, or swollen legs, they should contact a medical provider. Adverse events should also be reported to the CDC\u2019s [VAERS](https://vaers.hhs.gov/) system.\\n\\n**Continuing to build confidence in COVID-19 vaccines is vital.**\\nHealth care providers, public health practitioners, and communicators must continue to develop clear, evidence-based, and practically implementable approaches to mitigate vaccine hesitancy and [build trust](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/vaccines/report/building-trust-in-vaccination) in immunization.

This is an important limitation to the data that is available to track testing in the U.S., and states should work to address it.\\n \\nWhen states report testing numbers for COVID-19 infection, they should not include serology or antibody tests. Antibody tests are not used to diagnose active COVID-19 infection and they do not provide insights into the number of cases of COVID-19 diagnosed or whether viral testing is sufficient to find infections that are occurring within each state. States that include serology tests within their overall COVID-19 testing numbers are misrepresenting their testing capacity and the extent to which they are working to identify COVID-19 infections within their communities. States that wish to track the number of serology tests being performed should report those numbers separately from viral tests performed to diagnose COVID-19.\\n\\n[Learn more about why the positivity rates shown on our site may differ from state calculations](/testing/differences-in-positivity-rates)","media":[]},{"id":29,"slug":"testing-positivity-page-intro","title":"Testing positivity page intro","subtitle":null,"content":"If a positivity rate is too high, that may indicate that the state is only testing the sickest patients who seek medical attention, and is not casting a wide enough net to know how much of the virus is spreading within its communities.

Some states may be calculating the positivity percentage for each day, and then doing the rolling 7-day average. The reason why we use our approach is because testing capacity issues and uneven reporting cadences create a lot of misleading peaks and valleys in the data. Since we want to give a 7-day average, it is more fair to average the raw data and then calculate the ratios. Otherwise, days when a large number of negative tests are released all at once\u2014and positivity is going to be very low\u2014will have the same weight as days when data was steadily released, and the overall result is going to be lower. Our approach is applied to all our testing data to correct for these uneven data release patterns.

The lack of a standardized method for data collection and reporting among state and federal government agencies has resulted in an assortment of approaches. Some states report vaccinations that federal agencies administer to the employees working in those states, but other states do not. And CDC data does not identify the states in which doses have been administered at the local branches of federal entities such as the Veterans Administration, the Bureau of Prisons, the Department of Defense, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Therefore, a complete set of that data is not publicly available yet. This prevents validation of state-reported data feeding into the Global Map against the CDC\u2019s data.  \\n\\nThus, the discrepancy in the total national numbers of vaccine doses administered between the CDC website and the Johns Hopkins Global Map. **In addition, adding up vaccination totals for each individual state on the Johns Hopkins [Coronavirus Resource Center](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/region) will also not equal the CDC total.**  \\n\\nIdeally, we would be able to display vaccination data that matches with the CDC to provide more precise estimates of what percentage of state populations have been vaccinated. For example, veterans make up 10.3% of Virginia\u2019s population. If all those vaccinations are reported through the VA but not recorded in state data then accurate analyses of, say, herd immunity are not possible.

Adolescents and young adults from disadvantaged backgrounds, compared to more affluent and educated peers, struggle much more with health problems including obesity, asthma, neurocognitive disorders, and mental health diagnoses. Across adulthood, African Americans are more likely to die from all causes than their white counterparts.
